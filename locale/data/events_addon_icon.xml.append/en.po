"\tHave you ever thought about how cool it would be to play as the game's bosses? This addon adds that feature!\n"
"\n"
"\tCurrently, it includes four playable bosses, including the Militia Dreadnought, the Highwayman, the Haunted Flagship, and, surprisingly, Callie the Calculator. Some of the playable bosses have unique abilities that make them more engaging to play (for example, you can solve math problems with Callie for resources, and the Haunted Flagship has a unique surge).\n"
"\n"
"\tMore playable bosses and B and C variants for existing bosses are also planned for the future.\n"
"\t\n"
"\tTo enable Universal Threats, visit the Multiverse forum and the addons section, or you can find it in the official Multiverse Discord server in addon-announcements."
