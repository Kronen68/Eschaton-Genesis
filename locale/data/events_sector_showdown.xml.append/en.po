" what happened to me in this universe. Let everyone think that I just "
"decided to leave the Miracle Seekers... It will be better for everyone.\" "
"Mirrored turns around, sensing your gaze, and quickly ends the call. \"Ah, "
"Captain... I'm sorry I didn't show up in the meeting. I needed to tell my "
"friends something. Would you mind if I finish my conversation? It's very "
"important to me.\" You leave the pilot's cabin, and a couple of minutes "
"later, Mirrored catches up with you and starts the conversation. \"There are"
" too many pleasant things, people, and miracles in the world to cut off "
"access to them for all Universes. Despite all the difficulties and "
"hardships, your Universes need to go through this stage, not skip over it, "
"afraid of the problems along the way... In any case, the final decision is "
"yours, Captain, which is why I decided to issue that challenge just in case."
" However, I would still be grateful if you would consider your choice. I "
"will miss you and this strange, in a good way, journey in both outcomes.\""

"In the meeting hall of the eschatologists, a discussion flares up about the "
"current situation they find themselves in. \"This is not what we came here "
"for. We've done enough damage on the way here. We don't need to get involved"
" in this conflict any more than we already are. That's not why Castrophis "
"Station negotiated with the local government, represented by the Federation."
" We should leave immediately and abandon all of this,\" says one "
"particularly anxious eschatologist. Another eschatologist does not support "
"his idea. \"This is a conflict at the level of the Multiverse. If we leave, "
"sooner or later all these troubles will affect us too. We should use this "
"artifact.\" A third eschatologist disagrees with the second: \"There are "
"bigger problems in our universe than the possibility of it being taken over "
"by the Rebellion or the Obelisks. Moreover, these problems clearly won't "
"affect us in either outcome. There's no point in considering them.\" \"Then "
"what do you suggest we do? Leave here and hope that the Federation or other "
"savages of this universe don't find out about our original plan? Have you "
"all thought about what will happen next? How will we leave this universe "
"with Paragon?\" The first eschatologist answers his question: \"We will not "
"take Paragon with us. We will destroy it, or simply throw it into space. "
"Whatever happens next is no longer our problem. We have obtained enough "
"information about the other clusters of the Multiverse, and it is time for "
"us to return. The Castrophis Station and the Eschatologists' Community must "
"understand our situation. Right now, it is more important to preserve all "
"the knowledge we have gathered about this universe.\""
