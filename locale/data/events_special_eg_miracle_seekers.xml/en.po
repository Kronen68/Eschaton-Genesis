"Miracle 6419 - Neostar Form\n"
"\n"
"Operator: Corporate\n"
"Class: Standard\n"
"Location: Main hall of the Miracle Repository\n"
"\n"
"In my personal collection, this is one of the cheapest Miracles - it's barely valued at 50 Bones, even though it comes from a universe neighboring ours, which should already be an indicator of its rarity. Even though Miracles from the Thesis' Incarnation appear very rarely here, I won't argue that 50 bones is truly its true value.\n"
"\n"
"Neostar Megacorp is a megacorporation engaged in space freight transportation and the development of innovative technologies. It is a monopoly, formed by the destruction or acquisition of any potential companies that could compete with Neostar. It is also known for its slave-like labor conditions (though all megacorporations have this drawback) and the surprising ease of becoming an employee. Miracle 6419 is associated with direct employment with Neostar Megacorp. It is a small tablet with limited functionality. This tablet - the Neostar Form - allows any aspiring Neostar employee to apply for a job with the corporation from anywhere in the universe, no matter where they are located. Simply activate the tablet, and you will be greeted by a 10-item Neostar application form (see Appendix). These tablets are known to have been sent to many civilizations with which Neostar Megacorp had trade agreements, and were then distributed throughout the universe. After submitting an application, its review takes no more than an hour. Company representatives contact the prospective Neostar employee, who then formally employs them. They are provided with housing on Neostar premises and a steady salary. The Neostar Form is not given to anyone else, but becomes the employee's personal tablet, where they receive new tasks and deadlines, as well as the ability to contact customer support. Typically, every new Neostar employee is a general worker, meaning they can work in the warehouse or on cargo ships. There is no division into specialties, at least during their internship. Afterward, they undergo a so-called \"promotion,\" which determines their final position within the company. Before that, the employee must undergo an interview.\n"
"\n"
"This particular Neostar Form belonged to a certain [CONFIDENTIAL DATA HIDDEN] (1), who had been interning at Neostar Megacorp for eight months. They were earning no more than 185 Bones a month in our currency and were racking up numerous fines that prevented them from being promoted. Neostar didn't provide them with housing, but rather with sleeping accommodations in a backwater orbital station owned by Neostar. Apparently, they also lost contact with their home planet after accumulating too many fines, and to pay them, Neostar confiscated most of their personal belongings.\n"
"\n"
"Ultimately [CONFIDENTIAL DATA HIDDEN] committed [CONFIDENTIAL DATA HIDDEN].\n"
"\n"
"We learned all this information while examining the contents of the Neostar Form and recovering the deleted data. I received it through my trusted supplier.\n"
"\n"
"But the most interesting thing that happened during the investigation of the deleted information from the Neostar Form was that a representative of Neostar itself contacted us. Apparently, when this Miracle became active again, they received information about its reactivation, which leaked through the Treegate almost immediately. They offered us a cooperation deal involving integrating the activities of the Miracle Seekers into the affairs of Neostar Megacorp. But, of course, we declined. Nevertheless, the representatives left us their contact information (as if we had the same means of communication as they did) and allowed us to keep the Neostar Form in our storage as a Miracle.\n"
"\n"
"That's how it is.\n"
"\n"
"(1) * Mirrored's Note: Isn't it cruel to reveal their identity and the details of what happened to them? Please reconsider the content of the article - I beg you to do so (2)\n"
"\n"
"(2) * Corporate's Note: Yes, you're right. Sorry, Mirrored. I just thought these details were interesting and worth mentioning. Partly because a similar incident once happened in the SPC, but it was kept under wraps - just like with Neostar.\n"

"10. Do you understand that terminating your employment with Neostar does not guarantee the release of any employment obligations? Yes/No\n"
"\n"
"Please retain the Neostar Form until our staff reviews your application. We will contact you through it later. Application review typically takes no more than an hour. You will receive a notification if your application is rejected."

"Miracle 0900 - White Thread of the Expanse\n"
"\t\n"
"Operator of Miracle: Cipher\n"
"Class of Miracle: Artifact\n"
"Location: Artifact Compartment, General Compartment\n"
"\n"
"Proof of existence of powers of Contemplator Hollow and universal construct from which entire visible universe is woven - at least, ours. This Miracle is difficult to maintain in physical form, as it constantly tries to merge with space around it or become something specific, but a restraining mechanism developed by Erudite prevents White Thread from taking on a physical form other than that of white, almost incorporeal threads branching out in different directions.\n"
"    \n"
"We obtained this particular White Thread from its place of birth - a tangle of threads in Born Wasteland, in burial ground of Hollow. Concentration of White Threads in one place meant that they could not dissolve into space, since, in essence, all space was already occupied by them, and they took on physical form. This is the only place in entire universe with such properties - and that made us even luckier to obtain this Miracle from there.\n"
"\n"
"It is known that Hollow devoted her entire life to spinning space by creating new White Threads. She created empty spaces completely filled with White Threads, from which all other Contemplators could create their own worlds by cutting or altering threads with their powers. Most of space of Alseer's Sleep, and especially beyond Worldly Remains, was created by her. It is difficult to overestimate her contribution to development of universe, considering that she died at a relatively young age for Contemplators, outliving many of her brothers and sisters. Although her final death is still debated, it is also known that our universe is no longer expanding and no new space is appearing - although in practice this is difficult to verify, given that we still cannot reach edge of Alseer's Sleep and cannot confirm hypothesis of its existence.\n"
"\n"
"White Thread in our collection is also a strategically important artifact. If, in distant future, as a result of events of eschatological proportions, space begins to shrink, we will be able to cultivate a new ball of white threads from this single thread and stop process of space regression. Of course, I hope that this will never happen, as long as the Fleet of Six Sickles monitors stability of our universe."

"Miracle 9721 - Horn of the Insect God\n"
"\t\n"
"Operator of Miracle: Spore\n"
"Class of Miracle: Artifact\n"
"Location: Artifact Compartment, Biomatery Subcompartment\n"
"\n"
"The immediate biological part of Contemplator Yankhen. One of his two horns, consisting of highly durable \"divine\" chitin, is fragile, broken at the base, but has retained its integrity due to its remarkable resilience.\n"
"\n"
"The study of his horn helped us get closer to unraveling the structure of the organism not only of Yankhen himself, whose appearance resembled a cross between an anthropomorphic humanoid and a beetle, but also of many other Contemplators. It was only after obtaining real proof of existence of biological components in Contemplators, after many years of research not only by us but by the entire scientific community of Alseer's Sleep, that we were able to equate Contemplators with living organisms. Hypotheses about gods of our universe being organic beings have been discussed for a long time, but we had no direct evidence other than presence of functional blood, the Truth, in them.\n"
"\n"
"The study of Broken Horn also allowed us to study aging processes in Contemplators. It is well known that Yankhen was the first deity born of Primordial Mother Alseer, making him the first Contemplator ever to appear. Apparently, Yankhen's horns grew throughout his life - about seven hundred years - which suggests that the \"only mortal\" concept of aging is not foreign even to gods. This is also confirmed by fact that at the beginning of life of Insect God in the Time of the Unbridled Flame, according to eyewitnesses in the form of Cynics, his horns were much smaller, and he himself looked much younger than at the time of his death.\n"
"\n"
"The Broken Horn is imbued with a small amount of Yankhen's residual energy, but despite its small volume, it is enough for lower termites from Point Zero, thanks to their instincts and desire to be as close as possible to their god, to sense him and fly to him across many light years. This feature of Broken Horn forced us to isolate it from other artifacts in a special container that absorbs its residual power and prevents termites from knowing where the artifact is currently located. Although they seem to know that their god has long since perished, they still cannot overcome their natural desire to follow him - even a small part of him.\n"
"\n"
"As we mentioned earlier, this Miracle is made of highly durable chitin. Studying it allowed us to learn composition of Insect God's armor and how the Flame of War did not harm him, even though everything around him was burning during the incident in the Realm of Cynics. It turns out that Yankhen's chitin is so heat-resistant that it can withstand even the most extreme temperatures. For example, if you put it in the core of a blue giant star, not only would it not be damaged, but it would also harden even more, strengthening its protective properties for a while. However, chitin itself is very fragile, and this is probably why Yankhen's horn broke off so easily from his head when he died.\n"
"\n"
"It can be assumed that if Contemplators are indeed not very different from living organisms, they must also have concept of heredity. Nevertheless, the direct daughter of Insect God named Dawn (now Aurora) did not have biological chitin and had no horns at all, and despite her father's highly protected body, she had no protection at all. Moreover, apart from her great love for Lepidoptera, she had no connection to insects. One might also assume that she took after her mother, Dreamer, but in that case, she should have possessed at least some of her powers, which she never had. This proves that organism of Contemplators and many of processes taking place within it are still subject to detailed study. We know too little about gods who created and developed our worlds and with whom we have direct connections."

"Miracle 3385 - The Warmth\n"
"\n"
"Miracle Operator: Mirrored (found), Cipher (described)\n"
"Class of Miracle: Artifact\n"
"Location: Artifact Compartment, History Subcompartment\n"
"\n"
"This is an independent unit of Contemplator Aurora and one of components of her former mechanical body. In fact, it is a particle of her with a small amount of divine power, so small that it is barely enough to use. It looks like a spherical mechanism inside which heat is constantly synthesized, as if from nothing.\n"
"\n"
"This artifact was found in expanses of Everwinter and most likely separated from Aurora's main body during sinking of Icebreaker and forced destruction of Heat Generator. Then, years later, on the already sunken ship, in the very room where Aurora was imprisoned, this thing was found. Water in this isolated room was warmer than water in rest of ship, despite the fact that at that moment Icebreaker was already completely frozen, which already speaks to some of peculiarities of this artifact.\n"
"\n"
"Mirrored recovered it without much effort. At first, we thought it was nothing more than an external part of Heat Generator itself, but it turned out to be part of Aurora herself. Moreover, it was not created by creator of Heat Generator itself, Engin, and certainly did not appear after its modification by leading Everwinter engineer, Aesta. This became clear after our organization also found original drawings of Heat Generator with Aesta's notes.\n"
"\n"
"Research also helped to determine that this artifact is still directly connected to Aurora at the Essence level, confirming theory of its mystical origin. We also managed to find out that heat synthesis can be increased by connecting this mechanism to any heat-producing generator. Both mechanism itself and generator begin to raise temperature of air around them.\n"
"\n"
"Another interesting property of this miracle is that it somehow identifies person holding it and synthesizes heat in varying concentrations. We conducted research on each of Miracle Seekers to try to determine exactly how mechanism decides how much heat to release in each of our hands.\n"
"\n"
"Who knows, maybe this was her last gift to forever frozen world of Everwinter, which was supposed to warm it up at least a little?\n"
"\n"
"---------------------------\n"
"\n"
"Appendix. Level of heat synthesis inside Miracle while each of Miracle Seekers holds it. Level of heat synthesis is rated on a 10-point scale, where 0 is no heat synthesis or maintaining air temperature within 0°C, and 10 is heat synthesis sufficient to boil water - about 100°C.\n"
"\n"
"Cipher: 6 points. Felt heat.\n"
"Mirrored: 10 points. Explained that she felt nothing.\n"
"Hail: Refused to participate in study.\n"
"Corporate: 5 points. While discussing value of artifact, received a minor burn.\n"
"Shorekeeper: 4.5 points. Did not express an opinion.\n"
"Marauder: 8 points. Felt intense heat, but quickly released artifact from her hands.\n"
"Focus: [?] points. Upon contact with him, artifact disappeared and a white dove appeared in its place. Artifact was searched for two system days.\n"
"Erudite: 1 point. Felt cold, \"but nothing more\".\n"
"Mecha (directly): 10 points. Almost got burned, but one of robots took artifact away in time.\n"
"Spore: 5.5 points. Said them did not experience a temperature change.\n"
"Swordsman: 9 points. Suffered severe burns to his right hand while trying to understand how artifact works.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion: Mechanism increases its own temperature and temperature of air depending on character of person. In hands of cold and detached people, artifact produces almost no heat."

"\t\t\t\t\t\"In the name of Lady Secunda, the youngest daughter of all eternity, and in the name of our own name, given to us by our founding gods, we proclaim the creation of a Central Alliance, occupying the entire cosmic territory from the Heart of the Universe - the Belfry, all the way to the First Nebulae. Surrounded by numerous troubles, catastrophes and deprivations, disunited species and races are forced to gather into one colossal, essentially unified political structure until such time as Postulate ceases to be our common threat. We will valiantly repel all problems that may overtake us, and we will share our common history, cherish it like the apple of our eye, as long as there remains hope that existence will triumph over non-existence.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\"The Second Voice Station will become the capital of the Central Alliance - from now on, our core and heart. The affairs of the Alliance will be governed by a single government, consisting of a twelve-member commission of the former rulers of the space empires. Every decision made by the Central Alliance must be reviewed by each commission chairperson and agreed upon in such a way that none of the empires within the Alliance will object to the decision.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\"The work of the Central Alliance will be regulated by the Creators, who will make their demands or recommendations on the Small Council of Creators, long established at the crown of the entire Universe. No decisions taken to combat the forces of Postulate and the Darkness will be made without the private permission of the Small Council. However, any decisions made by the Small Council regarding the Central Alliance must first be agreed upon with Lady Secunda as a precaution.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\"Resolution of military crises, such as the inevitable absorption of the Thesis' Incarnation at the end of each Ashvattha Tree burning cycle, will be handled by a special military bureau, assembled from our finest warriors, such as the Lions of the Lion Corps, and the Inquisitor spaceships of the Great League. It will be called the \"Primary Suppression of Postulate Manifestations,\" and will actively defend the Belfry and the final Pillars of Causality - Time and Objectivity - at the Hour of Judgment.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\"The Great League and Terra Ultima will be allies of the Central Alliance, but not its direct members. We will actively trade and exchange technologies and knowledge, while maintaining our independent status. Independent organizations such as the Ermi News Block, Lighthouse Station, Vita Nostra, and Castrophis Station, including the latter's Community of Eschatologists, will also cooperate with us.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\"Complete regulation of space travel is transferred from the hands of the Enlightened to the Central Alliance. The Star Shipyards become the property of the entire Universe, but retain their independence. Now, every citizen of the Alliance will be able to travel freely along the Light Bridges. The Star Depot, meanwhile, acquires the status of a military-significant facility and will be actively used by the Central Alliance as one of its last precautions during the Hour of Judgment and other potential crises.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\"Each empire that is part of the Alliance is obligated to provide and share its resources, scientific and military capabilities, and to conduct open trade with other empires. In the event of failure to fulfill its direct responsibilities, the chairperson of the commission of such an Empire will be suspended for a certain period of time. In the event of a repeat offense, a special commission will be convened to decide on the removal of the empire from the Central Alliance.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\"To preserve shared knowledge and history, a Central Archive will be established on the surface of the planet Unio V, located within the Novalethe Empire. Representatives of this same empire will be responsible for collecting knowledge and recording history, and the Central Archive will be open to all citizens of the Central Alliance.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tErudite doesn't seem to tire of reading this document, but fortunately, it ends before you start to feel sleepy. \"That's all. It's worth mentioning that this contains the signatures of almost all the chairpersons of the Central Alliance commission. Sprawling, sharp, thin, spiraling, long, tiny, intricate, complex, illegible, intermittent, and... a typical, boring signature, probably human. And one more signature is missing - making eleven.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\t\tA huge amount of time passes before you finish listening to it all. It was probably worth it. All that's left is to somehow remember all the key points and head to Zoltans."

"\"In a universe bordering ours, there was a ruler of all humanity - Emperor White. He attained chronological immortality after coming into contact with a substance from our universe - the blood of God, the blood of the Contemplator. The scientific community in our world is still researching this phenomenon to this day - frankly speaking, we do not know how a man who lived thousands of years ago, according to the time reckoning of our universe, gained access to something that did not exist in his world and should never have existed. And since the blood of the Contemplator came from our universe, it seems that it bound the fate of the Emperor White to our world.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\"Because of this vicious connection, Emperor White's body began to belong to our universe as well. The divine blood inside him took the form of Miracle 0900 - a concentration of the threads of space that make up our entire universe - but not the universe of the Emperor White. We obtained this miracle by rewriting its internal code, essentially modifying existing information. However, it seems that we made a mistake and were unable to delete all the information from it - I doubt that this is even possible, given how everything is arranged in our cluster... And it seems that it was in this particular copy of the White Thread that the information about Emperor White, or more precisely, about his clone, was recorded.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t\"Emperor White cloned himself because of his gradually developing paranoia that the White Empire would not be able to survive if Emperor die one day - not of natural causes, but, for example, after an assassination attempt. He had enough enemies during his lifetime, so these fears were, one might say, justified. Ultimately, the clone of Emperor White remained autonomous and independent from the original, but they still shared the same memories and personality.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\"Emperor White's fears about an attempt on his life were justified after all. After certain events, now known as the \"The Last Eschaton,\" Emperor of humanity was convicted and executed. And then, when Emperor's clone ascended to the throne, instead of ruling the White Empire, he disbanded it and then integrated its remnants into another space empire. He then lived a long life and died for other reasons, not so important in our story.\"\n"
"\t\t\t\n"
"\t\t\t\"Due to the special properties of your universe, White Thread took on the form of a creature that was stored in its code, essentially returning to its previous state before we extracted it from the expanse of our universe. And now, strictly speaking, we can observe the reincarnation of the ancient monarch of those times when he and his clone were still alive. In essence, we are now dealing not just with an anomaly, but with the full-fledged Emperor White. It is impossible to find even a couple of differences between them.\""
