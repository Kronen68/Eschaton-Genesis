You receive a call request from the station, and a woman with what appear to be deer antlers on her head and very pale skin appears on the communicator screen. Her almost fantasy-like appearance mesmerizes you, but you come to your senses after she starts talking. "The Miracle Seekers welcome the Renegade ship. Do not be afraid, we are not going to attack you, and you are safe with us. We are looking for mercenaries willing to help us. Would you like to know more?"</text>

			<text>"Let me start with the basics: we, the Miracle Seekers, are an organization that collects Miracles and artifacts from all corners of our universe in order to preserve its history and prevent it from being rewritten. Miracles are considered to be any physical objects that have historical value, or are simply so rare or powerful that their free use could lead to dire consequences. Generally speaking, we find and store these objects at our station, where they are completely safe thanks to our impenetrable defenses."
			
			"We are not affiliated with your cluster and have no connection to your universes. In our home world, due to a catastrophic event, we were forced to use an emergency protocol involving one of our artifacts, which transported us to this universe without our consent through a certain space-time rift. At the moment of our station's transfer from our home universe to this one, we managed to scatter many Miracles throughout the sector, which we are unable to locate on our own at this time. This is where you could help us."
			
			"All you need to do is take on the task of finding a specific artifact, obtain it by any means available, and give it to our delivery drone. It's very simple; in fact, we would do it ourselves if we could leave the station without fear of getting caught up in conflicts at the Multiverse level. I know it sounds strange and suspicious, but it's the absolute truth. We don't want to interact with your universe in any way, even at the risk of losing our particularly important artifacts."

	<text>"An interesting choice. Miracle 6419 is a tablet for filling out a job application at Neostar Megacorp - a megacorporation from a universe neighboring my own. It is known for its innovative developments in many areas of life for the inhabitants of that universe, as well as for the fastest cargo transportation in the entire universe. This corporation has absorbed many smaller corporations, integrating them into itself, taking the best from them and leaving no room for anything bad. Although, of course, Neostar has its own sins - they have almost completely monopolized the entire space market, leaving no room for any competition. Wait, I'll contact with Corporate now - he is the operator of this Miracle and will explain the whole thing much better than I can."

			"A boring choice, I admit," the man almost interrupts Cipher. "One of the most boring. Seriously, partner, you'd better choose a different Miracle."

			Cipher looked at Corporate with disapproval. Seeing her expression, he smiled awkwardly and finally decided to share the details of the Neostar Form whereabouts.

			"The thing is, a certain soulless Hektar Industries employee has appropriated this Miracle for himself for some completely stupid reason. To convince him to hand it over to us, we'll need to bribe him... with a certain amount. But don't worry - I'll cover all the expenses, since I've already figured out how the economy works in your space. I'll follow you on my personal ship while you clear the way for me. Then, when we arrive at the Hektar employee's, I'll try to negotiate with him personally, and you'll simply act as my bodyguard and ensure the deal goes smoothly. Deal?"</text>

He knows how to use his charisma to his advantage, but he doesn't always know how to keep his cool with other people. So if someone tries to attack him, please try to protect them, regardless of who's right. That's all that's required of you during this task."

			Cipher looked at Corporate with disapproval. Seeing her expression, he smiled awkwardly and finally decided to share the details of the Neostar Form whereabouts.

			"The thing is, a certain soulless Hektar Industries employee has appropriated this Miracle for himself for some completely stupid reason. To convince him to hand it over to us, we'll need to bribe him... with a certain amount. But don't worry - I'll cover all the expenses, since I've already figured out how the economy works in your space. I'll follow you on my personal ship while you clear the way for me. Then, when we arrive at the Hektar employee's, I'll try to negotiate with him personally, and you'll simply act as my bodyguard and ensure the deal goes smoothly. Deal?"</text>

As Miracle Seekers, we attract too much attention as it is. I hope you understand! Meet me at the station's docking bay!" The holographic interface disappears, and you and Cipher are left alone.

						"Corporate has long wanted to explore the cosmos of your universe cluster and make a few... deals. He knows how to use his charisma to his advantage, but he doesn't always know how to keep his cool with other people. So if someone tries to attack him, please try to protect them, regardless of who's right. That's all that's required of you during this task."

						"Oh, and one last thing I'd like to say. If you're ever contacted by Neostar Megacorp, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, agree to work for them. That megacorp will leave you in the lurch."</text>

Miracle 7302 is one of the few Miracles directly connected to the history of the Thesis' Incarnation - the universe neighboring ours. It's an official document, telling how disparate cosmic civilizations decided to unite into a single Alliance in order to attempt to solve a common problem of horrific proportions. This might not seem very interesting, until you realize that this document was agreed upon not just by the majority of intelligent species in that Universe, but by its gods, the Creators, as well."</text>

Because even we can't come to an agreement with them regarding the transfer of this Miracle, despite the fact that we have all the evidence that it belongs to us and is being kept at the Miracle Seekers' Station as a Miracle and a historical artifact..."

			"You probably won't have to fight while completing this order, but you'd better be prepared for a long verbal argument with them. In any case, we'll help you if things reach an impasse.

	<text>"This artifact is the horn of Yankhen, the god of war, malice, vengeance, and... bugs. Although Yankhen has been dead for a very long time, this horn has been preserved in almost perfect condition." Cipher looks somewhat alarmed. It seems that explaining what this artifact is is very difficult for her.
	
	"We received this Miracle from a wealthy family on Stronghold, the planet where Yankhen died. The aristocrats of this family guarded this Miracle like the apple of their eye, and I understand them. A part of the body of one of the oldest and most dangerous deities... It's very scary. But I digress."
	
	"The operator of this Miracle is Sporie. I believe they can tell you much more about the order for this Miracle than I can. I will contact them now."

			"Sporie" doesn't even have a mouth - you wonder how it's supposed to answer, but then you hear a strange voice in your head. "Oh, that's very good! We are very pleased that you are interested in such an interesting Miracle - one of our favorites." It seems that the mushroom is talking to you telepathically. You look questioningly at the Cipher, but she lets you know that everything is fine.
			
			The mushroom continues to communicate with you. "When we moved to this universe, we were followed by Yankhen's followers, some of the lowest representatives of his race - termites. With the help of certain natural characteristics, they sense where their god is at any given moment and instinctively strive to be as close to him as possible. When we were in our universe, the termites didn't cause us any problems. We constantly suppressed the characteristics of the Horn, so his race didn't know that a piece of it was with us. However, during our escape from our home universe, we accidentally dropped Miracle 9721 into open space, and the termites picked up our trail. Now they have entered this sector, trying to find this Miracle before we do."
			
			"Termites work together and do not allow any member of their colony to be harmed. You may have to scare them away at first, but remember that you are essentially trying to deprive them of the last physical evidence of the existence of the god they worship to this day, which means that bloodshed is inevitable in this task. However, don't worry - lowest termites are semi-intelligent and more like animals than intelligent beings.

						Cipher shrugs. "Termites are a warlike race. Thank you for agreeing to help us find this Miracle - it is important to return the Horn to us, otherwise the termites will soon realize that their god is long dead, and will probably think that we or someone else is to blame...

The story of its appearance in our world is directly linked to Aurora, the Guardian of the Realm of Samsara. More precisely, to the most difficult period of her life. Without going into details, I will only say that this Miracle appeared as a by-product of the disintegration of her Soul after her spiritual body was locked inside a restraining mechanism."

			The interference flickers on the screen for a moment, but then subsides. "The eternally cold world of Everwinter... Perhaps the only place in the entire universe where I would not want to return. Its inhabitants condemned Aurora to suffering." Mirrored replies mysteriously.
			
			Cipher hastens to correct Mirrored. "King Crucis had no choice but to force Aurora to submit for the good of Everwinter. If it weren't for her sacrifice, Everwinter would have been destroyed forever. You understand that, don't you?" The interferences reply, "I understand... But it's still incredibly cruel. Even if hundreds of years have passed since those events. Even if the Contemplator Aurora harbors no ill will toward the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Everwinter."
			
			You ask the Miracle Seekers to get to the point, assuming that if you don't stop them both, they will start a long discussion. "Yes, exactly, the order... There was an unpleasant situation with it. In fact, we already sent one mercenary after this Miracle, but that was several hours ago, and now we have lost all contact with him.

What's more, since this Miracle is very dear to me, I will help you find it and keep an eye out for any dangerous situations, just in case!"

Despite the fact that in the event of trauma to your physical body, loss of mental stability, or irreversible loss of meaning in life after visiting our station, we will be obliged to place you in our private infirmary for treatment, find you a psychotherapist, or allocate funds for your independent recovery, some of our Miracles and information about them in the Database, when in direct contact with them, can cause so much harm that even over the next decades we will not be able to cover the costs that will be allocated to restore your usual physical appearance, stable mental state, or return meaning to your life after its loss. To be honest, we have huge problems with funding, and as an independent organization, if we look at the issue more broadly, we are still dependent on two other organizations and our direct sponsors - the Sarcophagus Forte and the Fleet of Six Sickles, which cover most of our expenses in our home universe, allowing each Miracle Seeker to go on weekly expeditions in search of Miracles to any corner of the universe without using our personal funds earned from our official jobs, which almost every Miracle Seeker has - and no, no one pays us for maintaining and searching for Miracles, with very rare exceptions, such as when a person familiar with our activities and wishing to place an item dear to them in the most reliable storage facility in the whole damn Multiverse contacts us and, for a reasonable fee, transfers this item to us and, for the period of its storage inside the Miracle Seekers station, pays a corresponding one-time fee, depending on the storage period of the Miracle. By the way, would you like to place any items in our storage facility for safekeeping, such as some trinkets? This process will cost you only about 2550 scrap per day your item is stored in our vault, taking into account all possible expenses for unforeseen circumstances such as an attack on us by the C.E.L. due to a violation of the laws of the space-time continuum universal to most universes, or something like causing any harm to our organization as a result of the contents of this oddity, which could lead to the loss of the Miracles, the loss of life of any of the Miracle Seekers, or the loss of the Miracle Seekers Station as a whole - and this, moreover, is a fairly democratic price, which, for your information, already includes a discount for Renegades like you who help us in finding Miracles we have lost and return them to where they belong, and which includes all basic services for maintaining the Miracle, such as daily analysis for any damage or optional cleaning of any dirt and dust... No, you don't want to? That's a shame. A rea-a-al shame. I would "like" to go through all that hell with you, consisting of a multitude of formalities, compliance with which ultimately leads nowhere, and which our sponsors have imposed on us, supposedly to ensure the safety of the Miracle Seekers first and foremost, and secondarily the safety of our universe - and, speaking of the safety of our universe, maybe you could finally sign this document or at least leave so you don't interfere with my work?

	<text>Miracle 6419 - Neostar Form

Operator: Corporate
Class: Standard
Location: Main hall of the Miracle Repository

In my personal collection, this is one of the cheapest Miracles - it's barely valued at 50 Bones, even though it comes from a universe neighboring ours, which should already be an indicator of its rarity. Even though Miracles from the Thesis' Incarnation appear very rarely here, I won't argue that 50 bones is truly its true value.

Neostar Megacorp is a megacorporation engaged in space freight transportation and the development of innovative technologies. It is a monopoly, formed by the destruction or acquisition of any potential companies that could compete with Neostar. It is also known for its slave-like labor conditions (though all megacorporations have this drawback) and the surprising ease of becoming an employee. Miracle 6419 is associated with direct employment with Neostar Megacorp. It is a small tablet with limited functionality. This tablet - the Neostar Form - allows any aspiring Neostar employee to apply for a job with the corporation from anywhere in the universe, no matter where they are located. Simply activate the tablet, and you will be greeted by a 10-item Neostar application form (see Appendix). These tablets are known to have been sent to many civilizations with which Neostar Megacorp had trade agreements, and were then distributed throughout the universe. After submitting an application, its review takes no more than an hour. Company representatives contact the prospective Neostar employee, who then formally employs them. They are provided with housing on Neostar premises and a steady salary. The Neostar Form is not given to anyone else, but becomes the employee's personal tablet, where they receive new tasks and deadlines, as well as the ability to contact customer support. Typically, every new Neostar employee is a general worker, meaning they can work in the warehouse or on cargo ships. There is no division into specialties, at least during their internship. Afterward, they undergo a so-called "promotion," which determines their final position within the company. Before that, the employee must undergo an interview.

This particular Neostar Form belonged to a certain [CONFIDENTIAL DATA HIDDEN] (1), who had been interning at Neostar Megacorp for eight months. They were earning no more than 185 Bones a month in our currency and were racking up numerous fines that prevented them from being promoted. Neostar didn't provide them with housing, but rather with sleeping accommodations in a backwater orbital station owned by Neostar. Apparently, they also lost contact with their home planet after accumulating too many fines, and to pay them, Neostar confiscated most of their personal belongings.

Ultimately [CONFIDENTIAL DATA HIDDEN] committed [CONFIDENTIAL DATA HIDDEN].

We learned all this information while examining the contents of the Neostar Form and recovering the deleted data. I received it through my trusted supplier.

But the most interesting thing that happened during the investigation of the deleted information from the Neostar Form was that a representative of Neostar itself contacted us. Apparently, when this Miracle became active again, they received information about its reactivation, which leaked through the Treegate almost immediately. They offered us a cooperation deal involving integrating the activities of the Miracle Seekers into the affairs of Neostar Megacorp. But, of course, we declined. Nevertheless, the representatives left us their contact information (as if we had the same means of communication as they did) and allowed us to keep the Neostar Form in our storage as a Miracle.

That's how it is.

(1) * Mirrored's Note: Isn't it cruel to reveal their identity and the details of what happened to them? Please reconsider the content of the article - I beg you to do so (2)

(2) * Corporate's Note: Yes, you're right. Sorry, Mirrored. I just thought these details were interesting and worth mentioning. Partly because a similar incident once happened in the SPC, but it was kept under wraps - just like with Neostar.

	<text>Miracle 0900 - White Thread of the Expanse
	
Operator: Cipher
Class: Artifact
Location: Artifact Compartment, General Compartment

Proof of existence of powers of Contemplator Hollow and universal construct from which entire visible universe is woven - at least, ours. This Miracle is difficult to maintain in physical form, as it constantly tries to merge with space around it or become something specific, but a restraining mechanism developed by Erudite prevents White Thread from taking on a physical form other than that of white, almost incorporeal threads branching out in different directions.
    
We obtained this particular White Thread from its place of birth - a tangle of threads in Born Wasteland, in burial ground of Hollow. Concentration of White Threads in one place meant that they could not dissolve into space, since, in essence, all space was already occupied by them, and they took on physical form. This is the only place in entire universe with such properties - and that made us even luckier to obtain this Miracle from there.

It is known that Hollow devoted her entire life to spinning space by creating new White Threads. She created empty spaces completely filled with White Threads, from which all other Contemplators could create their own worlds by cutting or altering threads with their powers. Most of space of Alseer's Sleep, and especially beyond Worldly Remains, was created by her. It is difficult to overestimate her contribution to development of universe, considering that she died at a relatively young age for Contemplators, outliving many of her brothers and sisters. Although her final death is still debated, it is also known that our universe is no longer expanding and no new space is appearing - although in practice this is difficult to verify, given that we still cannot reach edge of Alseer's Sleep and cannot confirm hypothesis of its existence.

White Thread in our collection is also a strategically important artifact. If, in distant future, as a result of events of eschatological proportions, space begins to shrink, we will be able to cultivate a new ball of white threads from this single thread and stop process of space regression. Of course, I hope that this will never happen, as long as the Fleet of Six Sickles monitors stability of our universe.</text>

<event name="MIRACLE_SEEKERS_HORN_OF_GOD_DATA">
	<text>Miracle 9721 - Horn of the Insect God
	
Operator: Spore
Class: Artifact
Location: Artifact Compartment, Biomatery Subcompartment

The immediate biological part of Contemplator Yankhen. One of his two horns, consisting of highly durable "divine" chitin, is fragile, broken at the base, but has retained its integrity due to its remarkable resilience.

The study of his horn helped us get closer to unraveling the structure of the organism not only of Yankhen himself, whose appearance resembled a cross between an anthropomorphic humanoid and a beetle, but also of many other Contemplators. It was only after obtaining real proof of existence of biological components in Contemplators, after many years of research not only by us but by the entire scientific community of Alseer's Sleep, that we were able to equate Contemplators with living organisms. Hypotheses about gods of our universe being organic beings have been discussed for a long time, but we had no direct evidence other than presence of functional blood, the Truth, in them.

The study of Broken Horn also allowed us to study aging processes in Contemplators. It is well known that Yankhen was the first deity born of Primordial Mother Alseer, making him the first Contemplator ever to appear. Apparently, Yankhen's horns grew throughout his life - about seven hundred years - which suggests that the "only mortal" concept of aging is not foreign even to gods. This is also confirmed by fact that at the beginning of life of Insect God in the Time of the Unbridled Flame, according to eyewitnesses in the form of Cynics, his horns were much smaller, and he himself looked much younger than at the time of his death.

The Broken Horn is imbued with a small amount of Yankhen's residual energy, but despite its small volume, it is enough for lower termites from Point Zero, thanks to their instincts and desire to be as close as possible to their god, to sense him and fly to him across many light years. This feature of Broken Horn forced us to isolate it from other artifacts in a special container that absorbs its residual power and prevents termites from knowing where the artifact is currently located. Although they seem to know that their god has long since perished, they still cannot overcome their natural desire to follow him - even a small part of him.

As we mentioned earlier, this Miracle is made of highly durable chitin. Studying it allowed us to learn composition of Insect God's armor and how the Flame of War did not harm him, even though everything around him was burning during the incident in the Realm of Cynics. It turns out that Yankhen's chitin is so heat-resistant that it can withstand even the most extreme temperatures. For example, if you put it in the core of a blue giant star, not only would it not be damaged, but it would also harden even more, strengthening its protective properties for a while. However, chitin itself is very fragile, and this is probably why Yankhen's horn broke off so easily from his head when he died.

It can be assumed that if Contemplators are indeed not very different from living organisms, they must also have concept of heredity. Nevertheless, the direct daughter of Insect God named Dawn (now Aurora) did not have biological chitin and had no horns at all, and despite her father's highly protected body, she had no protection at all. Moreover, apart from her great love for Lepidoptera, she had no connection to insects. One might also assume that she took after her mother, Dreamer, but in that case, she should have possessed at least some of her powers, which she never had. This proves that organism of Contemplators and many of processes taking place within it are still subject to detailed study. We know too little about gods who created and developed our worlds and with whom we have direct connections.</text>

<event name="MIRACLE_SEEKERS_WARMTH_DATA">
	<text>Miracle 3385 - The Warmth

Operator: Mirrored (found), Cipher (described)
Class: Artifact
Location: Artifact Compartment, History Subcompartment

This is an independent unit of Contemplator Aurora and one of components of her former mechanical body. In fact, it is a particle of her with a small amount of divine power, so small that it is barely enough to use. It looks like a spherical mechanism inside which heat is constantly synthesized, as if from nothing.

This artifact was found in expanses of Everwinter and most likely separated from Aurora's main body during sinking of Icebreaker and forced destruction of Heat Generator. Then, years later, on the already sunken ship, in the very room where Aurora was imprisoned, this thing was found. Water in this isolated room was warmer than water in rest of ship, despite the fact that at that moment Icebreaker was already completely frozen, which already speaks to some of peculiarities of this artifact.

Mirrored recovered it without much effort. At first, we thought it was nothing more than an external part of Heat Generator itself, but it turned out to be part of Aurora herself. Moreover, it was not created by creator of Heat Generator itself, Engin, and certainly did not appear after its modification by leading Everwinter engineer, Aesta. This became clear after our organization also found original drawings of Heat Generator with Aesta's notes.

Research also helped to determine that this artifact is still directly connected to Aurora at the Essence level, confirming theory of its mystical origin. We also managed to find out that heat synthesis can be increased by connecting this mechanism to any heat-producing generator. Both mechanism itself and generator begin to raise temperature of air around them.

Another interesting property of this Miracle is that it somehow identifies person holding it and synthesizes heat in varying concentrations. We conducted research on each of Miracle Seekers to try to determine exactly how mechanism decides how much heat to release in each of our hands.

Who knows, maybe this was her last gift to forever frozen world of Everwinter, which was supposed to warm it up at least a little?

---------------------------

Appendix. Level of heat synthesis inside Miracle while each of Miracle Seekers holds it. Level of heat synthesis is rated on a 10-point scale, where 0 is no heat synthesis or maintaining air temperature within 0°C, and 10 is heat synthesis sufficient to boil water - about 100°C.

Cipher: 6 points. Felt heat.
Mirrored: 10 points. Explained that she felt nothing.
Hail: Refused to participate in study.
Corporate: 5 points. While discussing value of artifact, received a minor burn.
Seakeeper: 4.5 points. Did not express an opinion.
Marauder: 8 points. Felt intense heat, but quickly released artifact from her hands.
Focus: [?] points. Upon contact with him, artifact disappeared and a white dove appeared in its place. Artifact was searched for two system days.
Erudite: 1 point. Felt cold, "but nothing more".
Mecha (directly): 10 points. Almost got burned, but one of robots took artifact away in time.
Spore: 5.5 points. Said they did not experience a temperature change.
Swordsman: 9 points. Suffered severe burns to his right hand while trying to understand how artifact works.

Conclusion: Mechanism increases its own temperature and temperature of air depending on character of person. In hands of cold and detached people, artifact produces almost no heat.</text>
<!-- The points here reflect the ease of making friends with a particular Miracle Seeker; the more points, the easier it is. The points also reflect how warm and open the person is. Hail points: 3. Focus points: 7-->

Then it takes augment from the pile and seems to head back to the ship to transfer them to your hold. You don't want to ask how Corporate gained access to your ship - you simply can't get into a conflict with such an eccentric person! Well, at least there are lots of cameras watching you from all sides, and attacking the Miracle Seekers could clearly end badly while you're on their territory. You get up from your chair and leave the living quarters, while Corporate waves you off. 
								
								For some reason, you feel that these 35 scrap are pennies to him, and it seems that the very fact of concluding the deal brings him more pleasure than the local space currency.</text>

	<text>The assistant drone guides you to the station's Security Room, located in some kind of storeroom. In front of the airlock leading directly to the room, you encounter two other drones, half the size of a standard assistant drone.

The station's Security Room is very dark, lit only by numerous monitors located throughout the space. A mechanical voice emerges from the darkness, yet it seems somehow very soulful, warm, and pleasant, imitating the voice of an elderly woman. "How nice to see you in person, Captain! Let's get acquainted. My code name is Mecha, the Miracle Seeker. You are now talking to me through one of my personal drones, while my body is in another part of the station for security reasons. However, rest assured that you have met a living person, not artificial intelligence - I think that would be too boring."
			
			You notice that there are four other drones in this room, all looking different and seemingly performing different functions, but none of them look hostile, which you can't help but be pleased about. 
			
			One of the drones hands you a heavy box. "This is my gift to you! Erudite has, of course, forbidden all Miracle Seekers from contacting you, but I know for sure that one gift won't hurt any "continuity". Besides, you - I mean all the Renegades as a whole, not just you - constantly help us and bring us closer to the day when we will finally return home. Thank you, Captain, for your service!" You open the gift and find some scrap and other nice little things inside.</text>

	<text>The assistant drone guides you to the Сentral Section, where the Miracle Seekers' meeting room is located. The round table is surrounded by eight chairs, which appear to be where the Miracle Seekers sit when discussing important matters concerning their organization. In the center of the table is a cavity containing a device that looks as if it is at least a couple of hundred years old.</text>
	<choice hidden="true" req="seekers_quest_started" lvl="0" max_lvl="0" blue="true">
		<text>You become wary. Something isn't right.</text>
		<event>
			<text>The Renegade's intuition does not fail you - suddenly, someone's fist flies past your face! You manage to dodge it and pull out your blaster, trying to find the source of such sudden aggression - and find it right in front of you in the form of a woman with long, crimson hair. "Surrender, Renegade. Your life is over!" she says, with no small amount of self-satisfaction in her voice, and takes up a fighting stance. You manage to see a pair of brass knuckles on her fists, but as soon as you shoot at her, she suddenly disappears, dissolving into something like a black mist. Immediately after that, you feel hands on your shoulders, and the cold brass knuckles seem to burn your skin. Think fast!</text>
				<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Quickly turn around and hit her!</text>
					<event>
						<text>You turn around and deliver what you think is a quick blow to the chest of the woman who attacked you, but as soon as your fist touches her, she disappears into the black mist for the second time. "Not bad, Renegade, but I expected something cooler from you. Put down your weapon, I don't want to fight you... at least not yet," a voice comes from the table. You see her sitting on it, removing brass knuckles from her hands, then demonstratively throwing them into the corner of the room. Her motives seem pure, and even though your blaster is still pointed at her, you calm down a little. If she really wanted you dead, she probably would have already achieved her goal.</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>What the hell?!</text>
						<event>
							<text>"Sorry, Renegade. I just wanted to test your reaction—and get to know you the way I usually get to know new friends. You consider Miracle Seekers as your friends, right?" You can't understand what's going on, and the woman continues talking. "Oh, yes. I completely forgot, Erudite told me that all the Renegades we meet are different people, even if it doesn't seem that way. Anyway, it's nice to meet you again. My name is Marauder, and I am the founder and leader of the Miracle Seekers organization". Marauder glances at you and gets up from the table. "I'd appreciate it if you'd put your weapon away, and then we can talk about a job I have for you. I promise I won't hurt you. After all, we didn't give you a guarantee of safety for nothing."</text>
								<choice hidden="true">
									<text>Put the blaster away.</text>
									<event>
										<text>"Keep it up! So you do trust us after all." Marauder looks happy and gets straight to the point. "I don't know if Cipher told you or not, but we got into this universe through a space-time rift... the most sci-fi and hackneyed thing ever. Because of its presence in this sector, we have already contacted the so-called "defenders of Continuity" more than once, who are trying to destroy us. We assume that the constant attacks on us by their automatic ships are due to the fact that the rift is still open - and, fortunately, we know how to close it (it seems that we will remain in this universe for some time anyway). However, we cannot do this ourselves for the same reasons that we cannot collect lost Miracles, and you can help us with this. We have... contact with the entity that lives in this rift and is, in fact, its guardian. All we need to do to close it is to contact this entity and carry out its small request so that it closes the rift and no one bothers us anymore."</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Listen more.</text>
												<event>
													<text>"I can guess your question: "what is this request and what should I be prepared for?" I hasten to say that even we, the Miracle Seekers, an organization that has been around for many years, have no idea what this entity is actually after. It does not come from our universe, but from a neighboring one, about which we know very little. Mecha tried to analyze its nature, but we learned absolutely nothing. However, we assume that the task it will give you will be to eliminate one of its puppets stuck in its abode... As scary as it is to admit, the death of these poor souls is for the greater good, but rest assured that they will fight you to the last drop of blood. Otherwise, this task will probably be even easier than the tasks to find lost miracles." For some reason, the marauder winks at you and waits for your decision.</text>

You calm down a little and let Marauder know that you won't shoot her unless she attacks you, but you don't put your blaster away. Marauder lowers her hands and seems to become completely calm.

The shot goes right through her body and hits the wall, but she doesn't seem to take any damage - not even her clothes are damaged! She quickly jumps off the table and takes up a fighting stance again. "Ha! That's really amazing! Well done, Renegade!" You no longer try to even scratch her and put away your blaster.

	"Huh? What do you need? We're currently closssed for technical reasssonsss."

	"One of your employees stole something of ours. We'd be grateful if-..."

			Miracle Seeker is silent for a moment, and you continue to listen to the slug's indignation. All you've gathered is that another Hektar employee has taken Miracle 6419 for himself and left his position at Hektar Industries to join Neostar Megacorp. This situation is comical, considering he essentially reclaimed his soul from the clutches of the devil and gave it to someone else.

			You ask the Hektar employee to calm down and give you the coordinates of the former Hektar employee. A few seconds later, they send them to you, and you disconnect from the Hektar ship. Corporate contacts you.

How about you just fly away from here, and I'll take care of our mutual friend, and we'll pretend we never crossed paths? We won't harm him, just ask a few questions..."

You can't make out its appearance, but you notice that it's sitting in an office, dressed in business attire, and in the background is a window overlooking space and a blazing, bright red star surrounded by a Dyson sphere. The star looks sickly, its size and color completely abnormal.

									"Greetings, intruder. My name is Saul. I am the CEO of Neostar Megacorp."

									Monitors intermittently flash with static. Your interlocutor is unimaginably far away. Most likely, in another universe.</text>

											<text>Saul seems to see right through you through the monitors, analyzing and drawing conclusions.

											"Personally, I suppose it's nothing. But you're holding something that belongs to Neostar. You're currently on a ship that belongs to Neostar. You're breathing air that belongs to Neostar. You're looking at me through screens that belong to Neostar. Everything here belongs to Neostar. Everything except you..."

											You look questioningly at the three-eyed amphibian.

											"I'd like to offer you a job. 15000... scrap, right? 15000 scrap upfront. Up to 200000 scrap monthly. As you advance in your career, you become Neostar Megacorp's representative in this Universe - you'll earn up to 500000 scrap monthly.

													<text>Suddenly, a shot rings out. The bullet pierces the largest monitor, disabling it. A second shot and a second bullet hit a camera in the corner of the room, which had been pointed at you the whole time.

													You turn around sharply. Corporate stands in the opening between the rooms, an old-fashioned, signature pistol outstretched. Smoke billows from the barrel.

However, we're willing to bet your friends didn't mention one very important thing. According to the Constitution of the Ministry of Zoltan, specifically Article 84-1, any physical object located on Ministry territory belongs to the Ministry and the Zoltan race in particular. This means we have every right to confiscate items of dubious origin and appropriate them for ourselves. This means that this document currently belongs to us, and you have no right to claim it until you can prove it's yours."

Also consider the fact that they could have "lost" it... if something belonged to you, you would certainly have tried to return it as quickly as possible, and you would have done so yourself, not through an intermediary. That's suspicious, isn't it?"

					"In any case, since you have no compelling evidence that this document belongs to your employers, we are forced to confiscate it. You can appeal this decision to the nearest General Jurisdiction Appeals Court under the Ministry's jurisdiction, but of course, filing and reviewing the application will take time you don't have... you are a Renegade, right?

	"My name is Erudite. I'm a Miracle Seeker, in case you didn't already know. This drone through which I'm speaking to you now is only one of many in this universe, so I hasten to inform you that its destruction should not be your goal.

			<text>"My apologies. This is just a precaution. I'll turn it back on as soon as we're done here."

			"We have significant ownership issues with the Miracle you're currently seeking. That's why we can't prove the Alliance Agreement is truly our responsibility. Formally, it doesn't belong to us, but we're still guarding it as a historical artifact. It's clear the Ministry won't hand this Miracle over to us directly, but there's a good chance they'll let you take it. We can't convince them it was always ours, but we can convince them it was yours before - we simply took it for safekeeping, isn't that smart?"

			"To do that, you'll need to learn the contents of the Alliance Agreement as a document. I'm against it, but Marauder insisted we reveal confidential information to you that we haven't even disclosed to our sponsors. I'll read you the contents of the Agreement, and you'll try to memorize it."</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Okay. We are listening.</text>
				<event>
					<text>Erudite clears his throat and begins to read the contents of the Alliance Agreement.
					
					"In the name of Lady Secunda, the youngest daughter of all eternity, and in the name of our own name, given to us by our founding gods, we proclaim the creation of a Central Alliance, occupying the entire cosmic territory from the Heart of the Universe - the Belfry, all the way to the First Nebulae. Surrounded by numerous troubles, catastrophes and deprivations, disunited species and races are forced to gather into one colossal, essentially unified political structure until such time as Postulate ceases to be our common threat. We will valiantly repel all problems that may overtake us, and we will share our common history, cherish it like the apple of our eye, as long as there remains hope that existence will triumph over non-existence."
					
					"The Second Voice Station will become the capital of the Central Alliance - from now on, our core and heart. The affairs of the Alliance will be governed by a single government, consisting of a twelve-member commission of the former rulers of the space empires. Every decision made by the Central Alliance must be reviewed by each commission chairperson and agreed upon in such a way that none of the empires within the Alliance will object to the decision."
					
					"The work of the Central Alliance will be regulated by the Creators, who will make their demands or recommendations on the Small Council of Creators, long established at the crown of the entire Universe. No decisions taken to combat the forces of Postulate and the Darkness will be made without the private permission of the Small Council. However, any decisions made by the Small Council regarding the Central Alliance must first be agreed upon with Lady Secunda as a precaution."
					
					"Resolution of military crises, such as the inevitable absorption of the Thesis' Incarnation at the end of each Ashvattha Tree burning cycle, will be handled by a special military bureau, assembled from our finest warriors, such as the Lions of the Lion Corps, and the Inquisitor spaceships of the Great League. It will be called the "Primary Suppression of Postulate Manifestations," and will actively defend the Belfry and the final Pillars of Causality - Time and Objectivity - at the Hour of Judgment."
					
					"The Great League and Terra Ultima will be allies of the Central Alliance, but not its direct members. We will actively trade and exchange technologies and knowledge, while maintaining our independent status. Independent organizations such as the Ermi News Block, Lighthouse Station, Vita Nostra, and Castrophis Station, including the latter's Community of Eschatologists, will also cooperate with us."
					
					"Complete regulation of space travel is transferred from the hands of the Enlightened to the Central Alliance. The Star Shipyards become the property of the entire Universe, but retain their independence. Now, every citizen of the Alliance will be able to travel freely along the Light Bridges. The Star Depot, meanwhile, acquires the status of a military-significant facility and will be actively used by the Central Alliance as one of its last precautions during the Hour of Judgment and other potential crises."
					
					"Each empire that is part of the Alliance is obligated to provide and share its resources, scientific and military capabilities, and to conduct open trade with other empires. In the event of failure to fulfill its direct responsibilities, the chairperson of the commission of such an Empire will be suspended for a certain period of time. In the event of a repeat offense, a special commission will be convened to decide on the removal of the empire from the Central Alliance."
					
					"To preserve shared knowledge and history, a Central Archive will be established on the surface of the planet Unio V, located within the Novalethe Empire. Representatives of this same empire will be responsible for collecting knowledge and recording history, and the Central Archive will be open to all citizens of the Central Alliance."
					
					Erudite doesn't seem to tire of reading this document, but fortunately, it ends before you start to feel sleepy. "That's all. It's worth mentioning that this contains the signatures of almost all the chairpersons of the Central Alliance commission. Sprawling, sharp, thin, spiraling, long, tiny, intricate, complex, illegible, intermittent, and... a typical, boring signature, probably human. And one more signature is missing - making eleven."
					
					A huge amount of time passes before you finish listening to it all. It was probably worth it. All that's left is to somehow remember all the key points and head to Zoltans.</text>

<!-- A message for anyone interested in the correct answers to the questions posed: please try answering them yourself. In fact, even one or two readings of the entire Alliance Agreement text is enough to answer most of the questions - there's no need to look up the correct answers here. This quest is designed specifically for the player to read the contents of the Agreement and only then answer all the questions. Skipping the text comprehension stage makes this quest essentially pointless, one of the easiest in all of Eschaton Genesis - so I strongly recommend completing it exactly as intended. The difficulty in this addon isn't always about difficult bosses, but also about complex texts like this one. Furthermore, you always have the option of answering one out of three questions incorrectly, which significantly simplifies the task of receiving the reward for this quest. However, I'm not urging you to accept my position on this matter - in any case, the method for completing this quest is up to you. The main thing is that you enjoy it. -->

	You pass through the outer airlock room, and three corridors leading to different rooms open up before you. Red emergency lights are flashing everywhere, and a very quiet siren is sounding throughout the ship. Where will you go?

Or maybe not. All camera recordings from the last half hour have been corrupted due to a system malfunction, but you can still view current recordings. As you look at the monitors showing real-time images from the cameras, you learn the following information about other rooms of the ship:

Weapon system: empty, but you notice a few unused missiles and broken weapons.
Sensors system: it's you!!
Door system: someone's body is lying on the control panel, their hand clutching the emergency closure lever for some of the ship's airlocks
Medical bay: the equipment is out of order, and in the corner you notice the movement of a small creature - probably one of the survived termites
Drone system: you notice an unattended drone and a couple of drone parts
Shields system: two human bodies lie in different corners of the room along with the bodies of termites, and it seems that there is nothing else there except broken equipment that can be dismantled for scrap
Hold room: it seems that this is where the battle between humans and termites took place. If you want to find out the answers, you probably need to go here, but its airlocks are closed
Piloting system: the ship's captain is lying on the dashboard, but he seems to still be breathing! If you can save him, he will surely tell you what happened
Reactor: It has been disabled and is gradually deteriorating, but there is an energy cell on the floor that you could insert into your reactor, but its airlocks are closed. It seems that you won't be able to stay on the ship for long, because if the reactor is completely disabled, it will become your grave

The rest of the ship's rooms have numerous breaches in them and there is nothing of interest.</text>

The note goes on to give the approximate location of the termites, which seem to have taken the Broken Horn. You should definitely go check out this place after you finish exploring the ship.

While exploring the hold, you also find some untouched lifejackets.</text>

You activate the Miracle Seekers' delivery drone, load the Miracle into it, and in exchange it gives you a decent amount of resources, then leaves the ship through the external airlock and quickly flies away. Half a minute later, Spore contacts you.
	
	"Excellent work, Renegade. The Miracle is completely intact, although it seems you had to go through a lot to complete this order..."
	
	"Termites have already learned of the death of their god, and we can no longer hide this. They will probably try to attack us next, but that will be our problem, not yours...

			<text>You still see a couple of termites near you. They slowly approach you, showing their peaceful intentions. This time, they are trying to communicate with you first.
			
			Surprisingly, on the communicator screen, you see not just a simple termite, but some other anthropomorphic insect-like creature that hardly resembles a familiar termite. It is thin and holds another termite in its hands, petting it. "Good day, traveler... We apologize for the damage caused to you. My name is... It's not that important. I am one of the remaining higher termites of my universe, and I look after my lower brethren. Unfortunately, I was unable to protect them and you from this incident, nor was I able to contact you beforehand, as I was unsure of your intentions. Since you nevertheless attempted to negotiate peacefully with my brethren, I hold you in high regard."

The other two-thirds went in search of food, but I'm afraid they weren't very successful. I would like to ask you to visit my brethren and, if necessary, either save them or help them get food... I will give you their coordinates. I promise they will repay you well, just say the following phrase: "Tskkk Clkkkk Tskkkkkk Tskkkk Clkkk." In your language, it means that you are their friend and intend to help them." You doubt that you will be able to pronounce this phrase, given that you have no chirping body parts, but you write it down just in case.
					
					The higher termite then transmits the coordinates of the rest of the swarm and shuts down, apologizing to you once again. Truly, a strange race...</text>

	<text>A little over half a minute later, enemy ship sends a signal to disable their ASB platform, probably because Mirrored has already contacted they and eliminated the communicator's interference. The ship's captain contacts you. He seems very distracted and frivolous, which contrasts amusingly with his position as captain. "Oh my God! We thought you wanted to destroy us, like those rebels who took the Miracle... Lesser Guardian greets his friend, the Renegade (after all, all mercenaries are a little bit Renegade, right?). Sorry for any damage we may have caused you... God, I'm so ashamed..."
	
	"We've had a... um... unpleasant situation. We lost The Warmth, as a result of an attack by the Rebel fleet. They spared our lives, but forced us to give them the Miracle and all our fuel, and they jammed our communication system, so we couldn't send a distress signal or contact the Miracle Seekers.

Its captain is talking to the rebels on an open channel. You manage to hide behind the nearest asteroids so that the rebels don't notice you.
	
	"Please... return this artifact. It is very important to my employer. To you, it's nothing more than a trinket, but..."
	
	"Shut up, Slavik. You left the ranks of the rebels - to be honest, we should have lynched you for that, but the command was surprisingly merciful. However, as we can see, you are going to challenge that decision. Trinket or not, it now belongs to the Rebellion. We will conduct a detailed study of it and use it for our own purposes for the benefit of the human race. These so-called "Miracle Seekers" have no idea what potential this little thing has."
	
	"I will not leave until you give me The Warmth. I'm not even asking for the return of all the other things you took from me. I... I promised the Miracle Seekers that I would return the Miracle myself. I will be forced to..."
	
	"Are you threatening US? Are you going to harm your former brothers in arms FOR SOME TRIVIAL REASON? Do you really think that your silly ship can even scratch the hull of OUR ship? AHA-HAH-AHA! You won't succeed, but since you want a fight so badly... We won't spare your life a second time. However, you can be sure that death will come quickly enough."

					Rebels immediately jumped away. Miracle 3385 remained on board, and, naturally, you failed to fulfill this order.

Another, smaller ship flies out of the anomalous ship and immediately contacts you. The communicator screen once again shows Emperor White and a couple of surviving members of the White Guard. "I suppose this is my fate. You came to kill me, so do it right now." He surrenders, although he still seems to hope for your mercy.</text>

During your battle, Erudite, Mecha, and I conducted an urgent analysis of the Emperor White anomaly ship and concluded that the main part of the anomaly was the ship and all its components, not the Emperor White himself - 99.8% of him, like his entourage, consists of universal biological components, and only 0.02% of Miracle 0900. This means that his murder is not necessary - the concentration of anomalous nature in him exists within the acceptable limits of this universe." It seems that you have not turned off the connection with the Emperor again, and he has heard everything once more, breathing a sigh of relief.
	
	"We have discovered not only this, but also something interesting concerning the copy of Emperor White... more precisely, the most interesting thing is not just copy of the Emperor, but copy of his copy!" Would you like a detailed or brief explanation of everything that just happened?"</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Detailed.</text>
		<event>
			<text>"In a universe bordering ours, there was a ruler of all humanity - Emperor White. He attained chronological immortality after coming into contact with a substance from our universe - the blood of God, the blood of the Contemplator. The scientific community in our world is still researching this phenomenon to this day - frankly speaking, we do not know how a man who lived thousands of years ago, according to the time reckoning of our universe, gained access to something that did not exist in his world and should never have existed. And since the blood of the Contemplator came from our universe, it seems that it bound the fate of the Emperor White to our world."
			
			"Because of this vicious connection, Emperor White's body began to belong to our universe as well. The divine blood inside him took the form of Miracle 0900 - a concentration of the threads of space that make up our entire universe - but not the universe of the Emperor White. We obtained this Miracle by rewriting its internal code, essentially modifying existing information. However, it seems that we made a mistake and were unable to delete all the information from it - I doubt that this is even possible, given how everything is arranged in our cluster... And it seems that it was in this particular copy of the White Thread that the information about Emperor White, or more precisely, about his clone, was recorded.

			"Emperor White cloned himself because of his gradually developing paranoia that the White Empire would not be able to survive if Emperor die one day - not of natural causes, but, for example, after an assassination attempt. He had enough enemies during his lifetime, so these fears were, one might say, justified. Ultimately, the clone of Emperor White remained autonomous and independent from the original, but they still shared the same memories and personality."
			
			"Emperor White's fears about an attempt on his life were justified after all. After certain events, now known as the "The Last Eschaton," Emperor of humanity was convicted and executed. And then, when Emperor's clone ascended to the throne, instead of ruling the White Empire, he disbanded it and then integrated its remnants into another space empire. He then lived a long life and died for other reasons, not so important in our story."
			
			"Due to the special properties of your universe, White Thread took on the form of a creature that was stored in its code, essentially returning to its previous state before we extracted it from the expanse of our universe. And now, strictly speaking, we can observe the reincarnation of the ancient monarch of those times when he and his clone were still alive. In essence, we are now dealing not just with an anomaly, but with the full-fledged Emperor White. It is impossible to find even a couple of differences between them."</text>

		<text>Briefly.</text>

			<text>"In one of the universes of our cluster, there was a ruler of all humanity - Emperor White. Due to certain events beyond his control, he gained chronological immortality, followed by a gradual decline in his mental health, culminating in paranoia that he would eventually die as a result of an assassination attempt. This paranoia then led him to the idea of creating his own clone, as the original Emperor White doubted that the White Empire would survive if everyone learned of his death. The Emperor's clone remained autonomous and independent from the original Emperor, but they shared the same memories and personality. Ultimately, after a series of events known as "The Last Eschaton," the original Emperor White was convicted and executed, and his clone disbanded the White Empire and integrated its remnants into another empire - all of these events took place thousands of years ago!'
			
			"Already in our time and in this universe, for some reason, Miracle 0900 "mutated" and took on the appearance of the ship of Emperor White's clone and the Emperor himself, while retaining all of the original memories. In essence, we are now dealing not just with an anomaly, but with the full-fledged Emperor White. It is impossible to find even a couple of differences between them."</text>

Alternatively, he can come to us on his own, and we will send him back to his home universe when we have finished our business here." Hearing this, anomaly of the Emperor White clone exhaled again. It seems that since his memories and personality are identical to those of the man who died a millennium ago, he can continue his legacy - just by not doing the things Cipher told him not to do.
	
	"Thank you for contributing to the development of our organization, Renegade. Good luck with saving this universe!" With these words, Cipher disconnects, and suddenly, the delivery drone in your hold activates, gives you a reward for completing the order, and independently leaves the ship through the airlock, heading into space.</text>

We lost the artifact that connected us to our home universe, and worse, without it, we cannot return."

																			Suddenly, your vision blurs, and after you rub your eyes, everything returns to normal. Nearby, you find the drone that is supposed to accompany you, the familiar space is visible through the portholes, and, most importantly, Hail is nowhere to be found. Only a pile of resources next to you indicates that everything that just happened was real, and it seems that you have indeed gotten rid of the gnome. You think that it would be a good idea for the Miracle Seekers to start a complaint book for visitors of the station.</text>
