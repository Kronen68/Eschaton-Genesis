		<text>What is Neostar Megacorp (R)?</text>
		<event>
			<text>Neostar Megacorp (R) is a leading manufacturer of Neostar Products (R), a distributor of Neostar Products (R), and a private transportation company. Neostar (R) is renowned throughout the Thesis Incarnation. We partner with most space empires and space political entities due to the low prices and high quality of our products. Another Neostar (R) achievement is the high speed of delivery of our products and those of our clients – in the Thesis Incarnation, there are no faster space transport ships than those used by Neostar Megacorp (R), thanks to Light Bridge Intersection (R) technology.</text>

	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>How often will I receive bonus payments under the Loyalty Program (R)?</text>
		<event>
			<text>Receiving bonus payments directly depends on the number of Loyalty Program Points (R) you earn to reach new Loyalty Levels (R). The number of Loyalty Program Points (R) you earn upon completion of a given delivery is usually limited to 2 Loyalty Program Points (R), but in special cases, if you need to deliver more cargo than usual, you'll receive 3 Loyalty Program Points (R). Typically, to reach a new Loyalty Level (R) and the corresponding bonus payment, you need to accumulate 5 Loyalty Program Points (R). However, when you start your career as a Neostar (R) Junior Employee, your first bonus payments may be issued with fewer points. There are 7 Loyalty Levels (R) in total, which directly lead to promotion.</text>

However, once you achieve promotion, penalties for cargo loss while you were a Neostar (R) Junior  Employee will be imposed. These penalties may include (but are not limited to): a reduction in your current salary, complete forfeiture of your previous salary, and forced labor on the planet Firstflood in the Neostar star system.</text>

			"Neostar is also involved in military development. It's no surprise that we received an order for artillery systems from the local capital government, the Peaks. "Peaks... Life is hard here," is a favorite phrase among the inhabitants of this zone of space. It's home to the poor, outcasts, fugitive criminals, and representatives of the lower classes of the entire Thesis Incarnation. There are always some kind of feuds and infighting among them, leading to internal conflicts, sometimes even bloody ones. Nevertheless, more than ten percent of Neostar's employees are former residents of the Peaks. I suppose it's only natural - rather than live there and fear you won't live to see the next day, it's better to sell your soul to our megacorporation, and..."

			<text>Uriel the Tailed greets you in a friendly manner and for some reason decides to tell you about this delivery.
			
			"It's not often we return goods to our homeland, much less dispose of them there." For some reason, Uriel the Tailed becomes sad after these words, and then descends into nostalgia. "Oh, I remember the time when Saul the Smallgilled had just founded his company on our planet, Firstflood. I was just a kid then, but I distinctly remember how his corporation - I'm talking about Neostar - began to grow at breakneck speed. Neostar's products - home appliances, furniture, and household items in general - were manufactured and shipped throughout the ocean and terrestrial world. Then Neostar began producing food and medical supplies, and began receiving government grants and industrial-scale orders. The number of factories across Firstflood grew daily. Neostar then became a megacorporation, absorbing the rest of our world's leading corporations, and also began engaging in military development, space expansion, and hydroforming..."
			
			"And one day, the government of most of the states on our planet fell. I won't go into details of how it happened, but Saul the Smallgilled didn't miss his chance, and, using his reputation and authority, became our sole ruler. Then he proclaimed a new vector of development of our planet - an industrial utopia capable of satisfying the needs of every individual. Now that Firstflood no longer had internal conflicts, we began to develop very quickly, went into space and began to conduct diplomatic relations with other space empires. Neostar... or rather, then Neostar Megacorp, expanded its borders at an enviable speed. Everything was really good, hell, I would even like to go back to that time!.. However, one day, the ambitions of our... ruler... went too far. He decided to use the energy of our star, after which the company was named, for the benefit of the company itself. When most of the representatives of our species had already gone into space, he decided to artificially accelerate the production of solar energy. This led to catastrophic events... Most of the water on our planet evaporated. We had a very small sea level due to the properties of our planet, and it simply dried up when our star became a red giant. Not all of it, of course, but... It's hard to call our planet a Firstflood now. Can you imagine how dependent we were on water?"
			
			"Now, almost no one lives on Firstflood. It's too hot there for water-loving creatures like us, and there's no humidity at all. Our species was forced to migrate to other star systems or orbital stations on other planets, just to live in comfort and not have to worry about being boiled on the surface of our planet. I'd be sad to go back there, even if I delivered a couple of crates and then immediately left. But what choice do I have as a direct employee of Neostar? Eh... I used to be a teacher, you know, colleague? I taught history to the fry... Where has all that gone now?.."
			
			Uriel the Tailed stares at vidscreen strangely, expecting something. "Um, I think I've said too much. I usually get fined if I talk to my colleagues for too long. The system has decided to pardon me this time... Well, let's get to work!"

It's difficult to explain why their work is important in our Universe, and even more difficult for someone from another Universe to understand, but I'd still like to try. Let's start with-..."

Considering the fact that you'd never be able to get rid of a Lion serial killer, for example, because you couldn't do anything to them. For such cases, Vitae Nostra scientists developed Quark-Level Disintegrators - machines capable of splitting Lions into millions of particles, then destroying each particle one by one.

			"Oh, Monochrome. A dying world. One of the worlds with the most tragic fate. It so happens to be located right on the border between Postulate's body and our observable universe. The Darkness consumes Monochrome daily, but this planet is incapable of dying completely. It is a deeply mystical world, not destroyed by Postulate's powers, but perhaps rather fed by them. However, this does not mean that Monochrome's inhabitants should not defend themselves - on the contrary, a complete transition to the power of the Darkness, while making them much stronger, will hardly make them happier, I suppose... Oh, I never told you who Postulate is, did I? Well, this being - or rather, the Creator - from whose flesh all things are woven in-..."

			"Funny delivery. The First Nebulae are essentially one large collective intelligence in the form of a nebula. Each individual particle, of course, has consciousness and can communicate with other particles individually, but together they represent something like a Boltzmann brain. Ever heard of such a thing? The First Nebulae - as a single collective intelligence - rarely interact with other representatives of intelligent life, but it seems they have now shown an interest in us for some reason. Oh, did you know that these are some of the most ancient beings in our Universe? Although there is debate about which space civilizations exactly were among the First, the First Nebulae surely hide in their depths one of the fragments of the key that unlocks the mysterious-..."
