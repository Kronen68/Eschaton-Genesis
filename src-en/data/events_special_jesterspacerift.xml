"Finally, someone is interested in me. I managed to escape from my own decaying universe, but I am stuck in the space between worlds, like all those who tried to escape from my "homeland" with me. Every year there are more and more of them, and there is very little room for all of us in this swamp between universes, and I'm tired of their company. Whoever you are, I propose a deal: I will redirect these creatures to you, and you deal with them in any way you see fit; I know how to pay. If you want to carry out this simple task, just send the message “I accept” to this space-time rift. Make sure you are strong enough to face these creatures - I take no pleasure in seeing more suffering than there already is."</text>

What are you doing here, and is your appearance connected with our liberation from the clutches of that tyrant? However, it is not so important for us to know whether you are involved in this... Better let us go in peace. Do not provoke an investigation, we are protected by Her gaze..." It becomes clear to you that this ship attacked you with some kind of psi-radiation, making you feel blissful in order to distract you.

The photograph is captioned: "The great brothers, the gem cutters of the school of light refraction. One history, one blood - forever."</text>

	<text>A strangely colored ship is rushing toward you from the anomaly. Its hull appears to be very thick and difficult to penetrate, but it has a lot of damage, and when you notice that the stern of the ship is made entirely of some kind of biological components, you feel uneasy. It seems that it has spent a lot of time inside that anomaly, constantly fighting someone, and only the thick hull of its ship was able to save it from destruction. When you accept the ship's request for contact, you see a very agitated boulder with a crazy look on its face on the screen. It immediately starts shouting into the communication system. "OH MY GOD! ANOTHER LIVING BEING! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE! GET OUT OF HERE, IT'S NOT SAFE, OR HE'LL DRAG YOU INTO HIS MACHINATIONS!" It's obvious that the captain is not himself; he thinks he's still inside the space rift. You have a choice: ease his suffering and receive a reward, or fly away from here before things get even stranger, but then you will have nothing but wasted time.</text>
