You receive a call request from the station, and a woman with what appear to be deer antlers on her head and very pale skin appears on the communicator screen. Her almost fantasy-like appearance mesmerizes you, but you come to your senses after she starts talking. "The Miracle Seekers welcome the Renegade ship. Do not be afraid, we are not going to attack you, and you are safe with us. We are looking for mercenaries willing to help us. Would you like to know more?"</text>

Miracles are considered to be any physical objects that have historical value, or are simply so rare or powerful that their free use could lead to dire consequences. Generally speaking, we find and store these objects at our station, where they are completely safe thanks to our impenetrable defenses."
			
			"We are not affiliated with your cluster and have no connection to your universes. In our home world, due to a catastrophic event, we were forced to use an emergency protocol involving one of our artifacts, which transported us to this universe without our consent through a certain space-time rift. At the moment of our station's transfer from our home universe to this one, we managed to scatter many Miracles throughout the sector, which we are unable to locate on our own at this time. This is where you could help us."
			
			"All you need to do is take on the task of finding a specific artifact, obtain it by any means available, and give it to our delivery drone. It's very simple; in fact, we would do it ourselves if we could leave the station without fear of getting caught up in conflicts at the Multiverse level. I know it sounds strange and suspicious, but it's the absolute truth. We don't want to interact with your universe in any way, even at the risk of losing our particularly important artifacts."

	<text>"This artifact is the horn of Yankhen, the god of war, malice, vengeance, and... bugs. Although Yankhen has been dead for a very long time, this horn has been preserved in almost perfect condition." Cipher looks somewhat alarmed. It seems that explaining what this artifact is is very difficult for her.
	
	"We received this Miracle from a wealthy family on Stronghold, the planet where Yankhen died. The aristocrats of this family guarded this Miracle like the apple of their eye, and I understand them. A part of the body of one of the oldest and most dangerous deities... It's very scary. But I digress."
	
	"The operator of this Miracle is Sporie. I believe they can tell you much more about the order for this Miracle than I can. I will contact them now." A holographic interface appears in the air with various symbols whose purpose is unknown to you, but it seems that Cipher understands them very well and is going to contact another member of the Miracle Seekers using it.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Wait...</text>
		<event>
			<text>An image appears on the holographic interface... is it a humanoid mushroom? It is quite tall and wears a stylish lab coat, but its head - a large red mushroom cap - looks very funny. "Sporie! Renegade is interested in finding Miracle 9721. Will you explain the whole point?"
			
			"Sporie" doesn't even have a mouth - you wonder how it's supposed to answer, but then you hear a strange voice in your head. "Oh, that's very good! We are very pleased that you are interested in such an interesting Miracle - one of our favorites." It seems that the mushroom is talking to you telepathically. You look questioningly at the Cipher, but she lets you know that everything is fine.
			
			The mushroom continues to communicate with you. "When we moved to this universe, we were followed by Yankhen's followers, some of the lowest representatives of his race - termites. With the help of certain natural characteristics, they sense where their god is at any given moment and instinctively strive to be as close to him as possible. When we were in our universe, the termites didn't cause us any problems. We constantly suppressed the characteristics of the Horn, so his race didn't know that a piece of it was with us. However, during our escape from our home universe, we accidentally dropped Miracle 9721 into open space, and the termites picked up our trail. Now they have entered this sector, trying to find this Miracle before we do."
			
			"Termites work together and do not allow any member of their colony to be harmed. You may have to scare them away at first, but remember that you are essentially trying to deprive them of the last physical evidence of the existence of the god they worship to this day, which means that bloodshed is inevitable in this task. However, don't worry - lowest termites are semi-intelligent and more like animals than intelligent beings. Although, of course, they are capable of thinking and reasoning in their own language."</text>

						Cipher shrugs. "Termites are a warlike race. Thank you for agreeing to help us find this Miracle - it is important to return the Horn to us, otherwise the termites will soon realize that their god is long dead, and will probably think that we or someone else is to blame... I don't want to witness the events of the Time of the Unbridled Flame, which destroyed my home, a second time."</text>

	<text>Cipher pauses to reflect. "Words cannot express how much I personally would like to bring back this Miracle. The story of its appearance in our world is directly linked to Aurora, the Guardian of the Realm of Samsara. More precisely, to the most difficult period of her life. Without going into details, I will only say that this Miracle appeared as a by-product of the disintegration of her Soul after her spiritual body was locked inside a restraining mechanism."
	
	"Mirrored found this Miracle, although we both worked on researching it. I think it would be best if we contacted her."

			<text>An image appears on the holographic interface, heavily distorted by some kind of interference, but Cipher doesn't seem bothered by it. "Mirrored, will you tell us about the circumstances surrounding the discovery of Miracle 3385?" asks Cipher.
			
			The interference flickers on the screen for a moment, but then subsides. "The eternally cold world of Everwinter... Perhaps the only place in the entire universe where I would not want to return. Its inhabitants condemned Aurora to suffering." Mirrored replies mysteriously.
			
			Cipher hastens to correct Mirror. "King Crucis had no choice but to force Aurora to submit for the good of Everwinter. If it weren't for her sacrifice, Everwinter would have been destroyed forever. You understand that, don't you?" The interferences reply, "I understand... But it's still incredibly cruel. Even if hundreds of years have passed since those events. Even if the Contemplator Aurora harbors no ill will toward the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Everwinter."
			
			You ask the Miracle Seekers to get to the point, assuming that if you don't stop them both, they will start a long discussion. "Yes, exactly, the order... There was an unpleasant situation with him. In fact, we already sent one mercenary after this Miracle, but that was several hours ago, and now we have lost all contact with him. All you need to do is check the last known location of our mercenary and make sure that the Miracle and he is safe, or return Miracle to us yourself via a delivery drone."</text>

"Well, you can get started on the order. The main thing is that the previous mercenary doesn't take it for himself... although I'm still sure that something bad just happened to him. He was so sweet and awkward when I first met him..."</text>

	<text>Upon seeing your selection, Cipher begins to smile slightly for some reason. "Oh, this is one of our most intriguing Miracles - a text file with unusual content on a physical medium. The operator of this Miracle is Mirrored, so no one can describe it as well as she can. I'll contact her now." 
	
	A holographic interface appears in the air with various symbols whose purpose is unknown to you, but it seems that Cipher understands them very well and is going to contact another member of the Miracle Seekers using it. "Mirrored will be very happy to know that you may be looking for this miracle."</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Wait...</text>
		<event>
			<text>An image appears on the holographic interface, heavily distorted by some kind of interference, but Cipher doesn't seem bothered by it. "Good news, Mirrored. The Renegade is interested in finding Miracle 1111!" A magical-sounding voice of a girl echoes strangely from the interface. "Oh, wonderful! Wonderful!" she says, and the interference on the screen intensifies. You look questioningly at Cipher, and she, noticing your confusion, asks her to explain what you need to do to find this Miracle. Mirrored doesn't answer you right away, apparently thinking about something. "It's... a rather unusual Miracle. It's hard to say exactly what you need to do to find it. But I assure you: the search won't take long and will be completely safe for you! What's more, since this Miracle is very dear to me, I will help you find it and keep an eye out for any dangerous situations, just in case!"
			
			Cipher looks away from the interface to you - and her emotions are unusually elevated. The whole situation seems rather strange, but it appears that Mirrored is completely sincere with you, and besides, since she is a Miracle Seeker, she knows what she is doing.</text>

						<text>The interference on the interface screen begins to move very quickly. "Oh, you really agreed! I am so grateful to you!" says Mirrored, and suddenly the interference disappears and the connection is lost. Cipher smiles kindly. "I will send you the coordinates of this Miracle. Mirrored will be waiting for you there to help you find it. Good luck, Renegade, and... thank you!"</text>

After a minute of awkward silence, she finally begins to speak again, either to you or to herself. "It seems that the Miracle Seekers are in greater danger than we previously thought. We have fallen into some kind of temporary anomaly, or... Oh, Contemplators..." Cipher realizes something and looks stunned, but after a couple of seconds, she returns to her usual emotions.

Despite the fact that in the event of trauma to your physical body, loss of mental stability, or irreversible loss of meaning in life after visiting our station, we will be obliged to place you in our private infirmary for treatment, find you a psychotherapist, or allocate funds for your independent recovery, some of our Miracles and information about them in the Database, when in direct contact with them, can cause so much harm that even over the next decades we will not be able to cover the costs that will be allocated to restore your usual physical appearance, stable mental state, or return meaning to your life after its loss. To be honest, we have huge problems with funding, and as an independent organization, if we look at the issue more broadly, we are still dependent on two other organizations and our direct sponsors - the Sarcophagus Forte and the Fleet of Six Sickles, which cover most of our expenses in our home universe, allowing each Miracle Seeker to go on weekly expeditions in search of Miracles to any corner of the universe without using our personal funds earned from our official jobs, which almost every Miracle Seeker has - and no, no one pays us for maintaining and searching for Miracles, with very rare exceptions, such as when a person familiar with our activities and wishing to place an item dear to them in the most reliable storage facility in the whole damn Multiverse contacts us and, for a reasonable fee, transfers this item to us and, for the period of its storage inside the Miracle Seekers station, pays a corresponding one-time fee, depending on the storage period of the Miracle. By the way, would you like to place any items in our storage facility for safekeeping, such as some trinkets? This process will cost you only about 2550 scrap per day your item is stored in our vault, taking into account all possible expenses for unforeseen circumstances such as an attack on us by the C.E.L. due to a violation of the laws of the space-time continuum universal to most universes, or something like causing any harm to our organization as a result of the contents of this oddity, which could lead to the loss of the Miracles, the loss of life of any of the Miracle Seekers, or the loss of the Miracle Seekers Station as a whole - and this, moreover, is a fairly democratic price, which, for your information, already includes a discount for Renegades like you who help us in finding Miracles we have lost and return them to where they belong, and which includes all basic services for maintaining the Miracle, such as daily analysis for any damage or optional cleaning of any dirt and dust... No, you don't want to? That's a shame. A rea-a-al shame. I would "like" to go through all that hell with you, consisting of a multitude of formalities, compliance with which ultimately leads nowhere, and which our sponsors have imposed on us, supposedly to ensure the safety of the Miracle Seekers first and foremost, and secondarily the safety of our universe - and, speaking of the safety of our universe, maybe you could finally sign this document or at least leave so you don't interfere with my work?

	<text>Miracle 0900 - White Thread of the Expanse
	
Operator of Miracle: Cipher
Class of Miracle: Artifact
Location: Artifact Compartment, General Compartment

Proof of existence of powers of Contemplator Hollow and universal construct from which entire visible universe is woven - at least, ours. This Miracle is difficult to maintain in physical form, as it constantly tries to merge with space around it or become something specific, but a restraining mechanism developed by Erudite prevents White Thread from taking on a physical form other than that of white, almost incorporeal threads branching out in different directions.
    
We obtained this particular White Thread from its place of birth - a tangle of threads in Born Wasteland, in burial ground of Hollow. Concentration of White Threads in one place meant that they could not dissolve into space, since, in essence, all space was already occupied by them, and they took on physical form. This is the only place in entire universe with such properties - and that made us even luckier to obtain this Miracle from there.

It is known that Hollow devoted her entire life to spinning space by creating new White Threads. She created empty spaces completely filled with White Threads, from which all other Contemplators could create their own worlds by cutting or altering threads with their powers. Most of space of Alseer's Sleep, and especially beyond Worldly Remains, was created by her. It is difficult to overestimate her contribution to development of universe, considering that she died at a relatively young age for Contemplators, outliving many of her brothers and sisters. Although her final death is still debated, it is also known that our universe is no longer expanding and no new space is appearing - although in practice this is difficult to verify, given that we still cannot reach edge of Alseer's Sleep and cannot confirm hypothesis of its existence.

White Thread in our collection is also a strategically important artifact. If, in distant future, as a result of events of eschatological proportions, space begins to shrink, we will be able to cultivate a new ball of white threads from this single thread and stop process of space regression. Of course, I hope that this will never happen, as long as the Fleet of Six Sickles monitors stability of our universe.</text>

	<text>Miracle 9721 - Horn of the Insect God
	
Operator of Miracle: Spore
Class of Miracle: Artifact
Location: Artifact Compartment, Biomatery Subcompartment

The immediate biological part of Contemplator Yankhen. One of his two horns, consisting of highly durable "divine" chitin, is fragile, broken at the base, but has retained its integrity due to its remarkable resilience.

The study of his horn helped us get closer to unraveling the structure of the organism not only of Yankhen himself, whose appearance resembled a cross between an anthropomorphic humanoid and a beetle, but also of many other Contemplators. It was only after obtaining real proof of existence of biological components in Contemplators, after many years of research not only by us but by the entire scientific community of Alseer's Sleep, that we were able to equate Contemplators with living organisms. Hypotheses about gods of our universe being organic beings have been discussed for a long time, but we had no direct evidence other than presence of functional blood, the Truth, in them.

The study of Broken Horn also allowed us to study aging processes in Contemplators. It is well known that Yankhen was the first deity born of Primordial Mother Alseer, making him the first Contemplator ever to appear. Apparently, Yankhen's horns grew throughout his life - about seven hundred years - which suggests that the "only mortal" concept of aging is not foreign even to gods. This is also confirmed by fact that at the beginning of life of Insect God in the Time of the Unbridled Flame, according to eyewitnesses in the form of Cynics, his horns were much smaller, and he himself looked much younger than at the time of his death.

The Broken Horn is imbued with a small amount of Yankhen's residual energy, but despite its small volume, it is enough for lower termites from Point Zero, thanks to their instincts and desire to be as close as possible to their god, to sense him and fly to him across many light years. This feature of Broken Horn forced us to isolate it from other artifacts in a special container that absorbs its residual power and prevents termites from knowing where the artifact is currently located. Although they seem to know that their god has long since perished, they still cannot overcome their natural desire to follow him - even a small part of him.

As we mentioned earlier, this Miracle is made of highly durable chitin. Studying it allowed us to learn composition of Insect God's armor and how the Flame of War did not harm him, even though everything around him was burning during the incident in the Realm of Cynics. It turns out that Yankhen's chitin is so heat-resistant that it can withstand even the most extreme temperatures. For example, if you put it in the core of a blue giant star, not only would it not be damaged, but it would also harden even more, strengthening its protective properties for a while. However, chitin itself is very fragile, and this is probably why Yankhen's horn broke off so easily from his head when he died.

It can be assumed that if Contemplators are indeed not very different from living organisms, they must also have concept of heredity. Nevertheless, the direct daughter of Insect God named Dawn (now Aurora) did not have biological chitin and had no horns at all, and despite her father's highly protected body, she had no protection at all. Moreover, apart from her great love for Lepidoptera, she had no connection to insects. One might also assume that she took after her mother, Dreamer, but in that case, she should have possessed at least some of her powers, which she never had. This proves that organism of Contemplators and many of processes taking place within it are still subject to detailed study. We know too little about gods who created and developed our worlds and with whom we have direct connections.</text>

	<text>Miracle 3385 - The Warmth

Miracle Operator: Mirrored (found), Cipher (described)
Class of Miracle: Artifact
Location: Artifact Compartment, History Subcompartment

This is an independent unit of Contemplator Aurora and one of components of her former mechanical body. In fact, it is a particle of her with a small amount of divine power, so small that it is barely enough to use. It looks like a spherical mechanism inside which heat is constantly synthesized, as if from nothing.

This artifact was found in expanses of Everwinter and most likely separated from Aurora's main body during sinking of Icebreaker and forced destruction of Heat Generator. Then, years later, on the already sunken ship, in the very room where Aurora was imprisoned, this thing was found. Water in this isolated room was warmer than water in rest of ship, despite the fact that at that moment Icebreaker was already completely frozen, which already speaks to some of peculiarities of this artifact.

Mirrored recovered it without much effort. At first, we thought it was nothing more than an external part of Heat Generator itself, but it turned out to be part of Aurora herself. Moreover, it was not created by creator of Heat Generator itself, Engin, and certainly did not appear after its modification by leading Everwinter engineer, Aesta. This became clear after our organization also found original drawings of Heat Generator with Aesta's notes.

Research also helped to determine that this artifact is still directly connected to Aurora at the Essence level, confirming theory of its mystical origin. We also managed to find out that heat synthesis can be increased by connecting this mechanism to any heat-producing generator. Both mechanism itself and generator begin to raise temperature of air around them.

Another interesting property of this miracle is that it somehow identifies person holding it and synthesizes heat in varying concentrations. We conducted research on each of Miracle Seekers to try to determine exactly how mechanism decides how much heat to release in each of our hands.

Who knows, maybe this was her last gift to forever frozen world of Everwinter, which was supposed to warm it up at least a little?

---------------------------

Appendix. Level of heat synthesis inside Miracle while each of Miracle Seekers holds it. Level of heat synthesis is rated on a 10-point scale, where 0 is no heat synthesis or maintaining air temperature within 0°C, and 10 is heat synthesis sufficient to boil water - about 100°C.

Cipher: 6 points. Felt heat.
Mirrored: 10 points. Explained that she felt nothing.
Hail: Refused to participate in study.
Corporate: 5 points. While discussing value of artifact, received a minor burn.
Shorekeeper: 4.5 points. Did not express an opinion.
Marauder: 8 points. Felt intense heat, but quickly released artifact from her hands.
Focus: [?] points. Upon contact with him, artifact disappeared and a white dove appeared in its place. Artifact was searched for two system days.
Erudite: 1 point. Felt cold, "but nothing more".
Mecha (directly): 10 points. Almost got burned, but one of robots took artifact away in time.
Spore: 5.5 points. Said them did not experience a temperature change.
Swordsman: 9 points. Suffered severe burns to his right hand while trying to understand how artifact works.

Conclusion: Mechanism increases its own temperature and temperature of air depending on character of person. In hands of cold and detached people, artifact produces almost no heat.</text>

	<text>The assistant drone guides you to the station's Security Room, located in some kind of storeroom. In front of the airlock leading directly to the room, you encounter two other drones, half the size of a standard assistant drone. Interestingly, these small drones seem to be guarding the room and won't let you in just like that.</text>

			<text>After a couple of seconds of signal exchange, the airlock opens and the drones let you in. The station's Security Room is very dark, lit only by numerous monitors located throughout the space. A mechanical voice emerges from the darkness, yet it seems somehow very soulful, warm, and pleasant, imitating the voice of an elderly woman. "How nice to see you in person, Captain! Let's get acquainted. My code name is Mecha, the Miracle Seeker. You are now talking to me through one of my personal drones, while my body is in another part of the station for security reasons. However, rest assured that you have met a living person, not artificial intelligence - I think that would be too boring."
			
			You notice that there are four other drones in this room, all looking different and seemingly performing different functions, but none of them look hostile, which you can't help but be pleased about. 
			
			One of the drones hands you a heavy box. "This is my gift to you! Erudite has, of course, forbidden all Miracle Seekers from contacting you, but I know for sure that one gift won't hurt any "continuity". Besides, you - I mean all the Renegades as a whole, not just you - constantly help us and bring us closer to the day when we will finally return home. Thank you, Captain, for your service!" You open the gift and find some scrap and other nice little things inside.</text>

<event name="MIRACLE_SEEKERS_SPACE_RIFT">
	<text>The assistant drone guides you to the Сentral Section, where the Miracle Seekers' meeting room is located. The round table is surrounded by eight chairs, which appear to be where the Miracle Seekers sit when discussing important matters concerning their organization. In the center of the table is a cavity containing a device that looks as if it is at least a couple of hundred years old.</text>
	<choice hidden="true" req="seekers_quest_started" lvl="0" max_lvl="0" blue="true">
		<text>You become wary. Something isn't right.</text>
		<event>
			<text>The Renegade's intuition does not fail you - suddenly, someone's fist flies past your face! You manage to dodge it and pull out your blaster, trying to find the source of such sudden aggression - and find it right in front of you in the form of a woman with long, crimson hair. "Surrender, Renegade. Your life is over!" she says, with no small amount of self-satisfaction in her voice, and takes up a fighting stance. You manage to see a pair of brass knuckles on her fists, but as soon as you shoot at her, she suddenly disappears, dissolving into something like a black mist. Immediately after that, you feel hands on your shoulders, and the cold brass knuckles seem to burn your skin. Think fast!</text>
				<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Quickly turn around and hit her!</text>
					<event>
						<text>You turn around and deliver what you think is a quick blow to the chest of the woman who attacked you, but as soon as your fist touches her, she disappears into the black mist for the second time. "Not bad, Renegade, but I expected something cooler from you. Put down your weapon, I don't want to fight you... at least not yet," a voice comes from the table. You see her sitting on it, removing brass knuckles from her hands, then demonstratively throwing them into the corner of the room. Her motives seem pure, and even though your blaster is still pointed at her, you calm down a little. If she really wanted you dead, she probably would have already achieved her goal.</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>What the hell?!</text>
						<event>
							<text>"Sorry, Renegade. I just wanted to test your reaction—and get to know you the way I usually get to know new friends. You consider Miracle Seekers as your friends, right?" You can't understand what's going on, and the woman continues talking. "Oh, yes. I completely forgot, Erudite told me that all the Renegades we meet are different people, even if it doesn't seem that way. Anyway, it's nice to meet you again. My name is Marauder, and I am the founder and leader of the Miracle Seekers organization". Marauder glances at you and gets up from the table. "I'd appreciate it if you'd put your weapon away, and then we can talk about a job I have for you. I promise I won't hurt you. After all, we didn't give you a guarantee of safety for nothing."</text>
								<choice hidden="true">
									<text>Put the blaster away.</text>
									<event>
										<text>"Keep it up! So you do trust us after all." Marauder looks happy and gets straight to the point. "I don't know if Cipher told you or not, but we got into this universe through a space-time rift... the most sci-fi and hackneyed thing ever. Because of its presence in this sector, we have already contacted the so-called "defenders of Continuity" more than once, who are trying to destroy us. We assume that the constant attacks on us by their automatic ships are due to the fact that the rift is still open - and, fortunately, we know how to close it (it seems that we will remain in this universe for some time anyway). However, we cannot do this ourselves for the same reasons that we cannot collect lost Miracles, and you can help us with this. We have... contact with the entity that lives in this rift and is, in fact, its guardian. All we need to do to close it is to contact this entity and carry out its small request so that it closes the rift and no one bothers us anymore."</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Listen more.</text>
												<event>
													<text>"I can guess your question: "what is this request and what should I be prepared for?" I hasten to say that even we, the Miracle Seekers, an organization that has been around for many years, have no idea what this entity is actually after. It does not come from our universe, but from a neighboring one, about which we know very little. Mecha tried to analyze its nature, but we learned absolutely nothing. However, we assume that the task it will give you will be to eliminate one of its puppets stuck in its abode... As scary as it is to admit, the death of these poor souls is for the greater good, but rest assured that they will fight you to the last drop of blood. Otherwise, this task will probably be even easier than the tasks to find lost miracles." For some reason, the marauder winks at you and waits for your decision.</text>

You calm down a little and let Marauder know that you won't shoot her unless she attacks you, but you don't put your blaster away. Marauder lowers her hands and seems to become completely calm. "Speaking of the mission... We need your help to close the rift in space that brought us to this universe. It's causing us problems and attracting unwanted attention to our organization.

The shot goes right through her body and hits the wall, but she doesn't seem to take any damage - not even her clothes are damaged! She quickly jumps off the table and takes up a fighting stance again. "Ha! That's really amazing! Well done, Renegade!" You no longer try to even scratch her and put away your blaster.

Or maybe not. All camera recordings from the last half hour have been corrupted due to a system malfunction, but you can still view current recordings. As you look at the monitors showing real-time images from the cameras, you learn the following information about other rooms of the ship:

Weapon system: empty, but you notice a few unused missiles and broken weapons.
Sensors system: it's you!!
Door system: someone's body is lying on the control panel, their hand clutching the emergency closure lever for some of the ship's airlocks
Medical bay: the equipment is out of order, and in the corner you notice the movement of a small creature - probably one of the survived termites
Drone system: you notice an unattended drone and a couple of drone parts
Shields system: two human bodies lie in different corners of the room along with the bodies of termites, and it seems that there is nothing else there except broken equipment that can be dismantled for scrap
Hold room: it seems that this is where the battle between humans and termites took place. If you want to find out the answers, you probably need to go here, but its airlocks are closed
Piloting system: the ship's captain is lying on the dashboard, but he seems to still be breathing! If you can save him, he will surely tell you what happened
Reactor: It has been disabled and is gradually deteriorating, but there is an energy cell on the floor that you could insert into your reactor, but its airlocks are closed. It seems that you won't be able to stay on the ship for long, because if the reactor is completely disabled, it will become your grave

The rest of the ship's rooms have numerous breaches in them and there is nothing of interest.</text>

The note goes on to give the approximate location of the termites, which seem to have taken the Broken Horn. You should definitely go check out this place after you finish exploring the ship.

	<text>The termites scatter in different directions, leaving the Broken Horn drifting in space. They are clearly devastated - not only have they learned that their god is dead, but you have also destroyed their main source of power.
	
	You pick up Miracle 9721. It is surprisingly heavy, even though the horn itself is no more than thirty centimeters long. You activate the Miracle Seekers' delivery drone, load the Miracle into it, and in exchange it gives you a decent amount of resources, then leaves the ship through the external airlock and quickly flies away. Half a minute later, Spore contacts you.
	
	"Excellent work, Renegade. The miracle is completely intact, although it seems you had to go through a lot to complete this order..."
	
	"Termites have already learned of the death of their god, and we can no longer hide this. They will probably try to attack us next, but that will be our problem, not yours... We will try to reason with them and spare their lives. Thank you again." When Spore disconnects, you finally exhale - the mushroom's telepathic abilities are not having the best effect on you, although perhaps if you communicate with it more often, this effect will wear off.</text>

			<text>You still see a couple of termites near you. They slowly approach you, showing their peaceful intentions. This time, they are trying to communicate with you first.
			
			Surprisingly, on the communicator screen, you see not just a simple termite, but some other anthropomorphic insect-like creature that hardly resembles a familiar termite. It is thin and holds another termite in its hands, petting it. "Good day, traveler... We apologize for the damage caused to you. My name is... It's not that important. I am one of the remaining higher termites of my universe, and I look after my lower brethren. Unfortunately, I was unable to protect them and you from this incident, nor was I able to contact you beforehand, as I was unsure of your intentions. Since you nevertheless attempted to negotiate peacefully with my brethren, I hold you in high regard."
			
			This higher termite speaks to you with almost no accent. It is unclear how he knows the standardized language, but he seems to be much more intelligent and clever than the lower termites, not to mention his physical appearance.</text>
			<choice hidden="true">

					<text>"We - that is, myself and my lesser brethren - need a mediator to contact this world. The termites you just fought, and who remain alive, are only a third of our entire swarm, which became entangled in this universe following the Miracle Seekers. The other two-thirds went in search of food, but I'm afraid they weren't very successful. I would like to ask you to visit my brethren and, if necessary, either save them or help them get food... I will give you their coordinates. I promise they will repay you well, just say the following phrase: "Tskkk Clkkkk Tskkkkkk Tskkkk Clkkk." In your language, it means that you are their friend and intend to help them." You doubt that you will be able to pronounce this phrase, given that you have no chirping body parts, but you write it down just in case.
					
					The higher termite then transmits the coordinates of the rest of the swarm and shuts down, apologizing to you once again. Truly, a strange race...</text>

Sorry for any damage we may have caused you... God, I'm so ashamed..."

	"Please... return this artifact. It is very important to my employer. To you, it's nothing more than a trinket, but..."
	
	"Shut up, Slavik. You left the ranks of the rebels - to be honest, we should have lynched you for that, but the command was surprisingly merciful. However, as we can see, you are going to challenge that decision. Trinket or not, it now belongs to the Rebellion. We will conduct a detailed study of it and use it for our own purposes for the benefit of the human race. These so-called "Miracle Seekers" have no idea what potential this little thing has."

	You give this Miracle to the Miracle Seekers' delivery drone. It opens its inner part, takes the Miracle from you, and gives you a reward for successfully completing the order. Then you charge your FTL, watching as Lesser Guardian jumps in the opposite direction.</text>

	Together with Slavik, you examine the wreckage of the MFK ace ship and, fortunately, find a Miracle intact and undamaged. It looks like some kind of energy core, surprisingly hot to the touch - you can barely touch it without feeling pain from the heat.

	Slavik contacts Mirrored via the communication system when he returns to the ship. You join the conversation on your ship, seeing interference on your communicator. "Such an important artifact was saved after all. Thank you both, Renegade and Mercenary. It seems you've become friends during this story," Mirrored says enthusiastically. "But unfortunately, we cannot give you two rewards for completing this order. You know how difficult the situation is for our organization..."
	
	Slavik replies: "We both agree to split one reward equally. No problem." Mirrored could not have expected a different outcome - and is very happy about it.
	
	"Truly, new acquaintances are much more important than material goods! Thank you again! Your overall contribution to the restoration of our organization will be highly appreciated. Give the Miracle to one of the delivery drones on one of your ships and share the reward yourselves," says Miracle Seeker, and disconnects.</text>

Three self-deploying ASB platforms fly out of the main airlock of the Lesser Guardian in assembled form. They are slightly smaller than the ones Slavik used. "You can use them as you see fit. I think they will be very useful to you, considering that you don't need anything to launch them. Well, goodbye, Captain! Good luck with suppressing the Rebellion! I believe in you. As for me, I need to get to the nearest store, I guess... I'm running out of fuel again." Slavik hastily jumps away, leaving you behind.

			<text>You remind Mirrored that all this was not in vain. You were able to thank a large number of people along the way, and the fact that Miracle did not appear for some reason is not Mirrored's fault, but Miracle's own. Although it seems to have been irretrievably lost, during these events you gained something more important. "...You are, of course, right... That's probably how life works. I shouldn't blame myself for not finding Miracle 1111, because I'm sure we did everything right."

Mirrored disappears for a couple of minutes and then returns to your ship. At the same time, you notice a Miracle Seekers delivery drone rushing towards you. "I asked for a little more resources than originally planned for the completion of our mission." You accept the reward from the delivery drone.

"Now... I can return to the station with a clear conscience. Thank you, Captain! I love meeting different people - each of them helps me understand myself better, and you are no exception."

Although Miracle 1111 - "Thank you" seems to have been destroyed, lost forever, or never existed at all, at least you understood how important it is to give and receive gratitude.</text>

		<text>Detailed.</text>
		<event>
			<text>"In a universe bordering ours, there was a ruler of all humanity - Emperor White. He attained chronological immortality after coming into contact with a substance from our universe - the blood of God, the blood of the Contemplator. The scientific community in our world is still researching this phenomenon to this day - frankly speaking, we do not know how a man who lived thousands of years ago, according to the time reckoning of our universe, gained access to something that did not exist in his world and should never have existed. And since the blood of the Contemplator came from our universe, it seems that it bound the fate of the Emperor White to our world."
			
			"Because of this vicious connection, Emperor White's body began to belong to our universe as well. The divine blood inside him took the form of Miracle 0900 - a concentration of the threads of space that make up our entire universe - but not the universe of the Emperor White. We obtained this miracle by rewriting its internal code, essentially modifying existing information. However, it seems that we made a mistake and were unable to delete all the information from it - I doubt that this is even possible, given how everything is arranged in our cluster... And it seems that it was in this particular copy of the White Thread that the information about Emperor White, or more precisely, about his clone, was recorded.

			"Emperor White cloned himself because of his gradually developing paranoia that the White Empire would not be able to survive if Emperor die one day - not of natural causes, but, for example, after an assassination attempt. He had enough enemies during his lifetime, so these fears were, one might say, justified. Ultimately, the clone of Emperor White remained autonomous and independent from the original, but they still shared the same memories and personality."
			
			"Emperor White's fears about an attempt on his life were justified after all. After certain events, now known as the "The Last Eschaton," Emperor of humanity was convicted and executed. And then, when Emperor's clone ascended to the throne, instead of ruling the White Empire, he disbanded it and then integrated its remnants into another space empire. He then lived a long life and died for other reasons, not so important in our story."
			
			"Due to the special properties of your universe, White Thread took on the form of a creature that was stored in its code, essentially returning to its previous state before we extracted it from the expanse of our universe. And now, strictly speaking, we can observe the reincarnation of the ancient monarch of those times when he and his clone were still alive. In essence, we are now dealing not just with an anomaly, but with the full-fledged Emperor White. It is impossible to find even a couple of differences between them."</text>

Due to certain events beyond his control, he gained chronological immortality, followed by a gradual decline in his mental health, culminating in paranoia that he would eventually die as a result of an assassination attempt. This paranoia then led him to the idea of creating his own clone, as the original Emperor White doubted that the White Empire would survive if everyone learned of his death. The Emperor's clone remained autonomous and independent from the original Emperor, but they shared the same memories and personality. Ultimately, after a series of events known as "The Last Eshaton," the original Emperor White was convicted and executed, and his clone disbanded the White Empire and integrated its remnants into another empire - all of these events took place thousands of years ago!'
			
			"Already in our time and in this universe, for some reason, Miracle 0900 "mutated" and took on the appearance of the ship of Emperor White's clone and the Emperor himself, while retaining all of the original memories. In essence, we are now dealing not just with an anomaly, but with the full-fledged Emperor White. It is impossible to find even a couple of differences between them."</text>

It seems that since his memories and personality are identical to those of the man who died a millennium ago, he can continue his legacy - just by not doing the things Cipher told him not to do.
	
	"Thank you for contributing to the development of our organization, Renegade. Good luck with saving this universe!"

	<text>You dock with the Miracle Seekers station. The station's AI welcomes you in the outer airlock room and asks you to proceed to the next room. There, you are sprayed with hot steam mixed with some kind of additive to clean your clothes of possible toxins or harmful bacteria. You are then allowed into the next room, in the center of which stands a mechanism that, with your permission, uses a laser system to analyze you and enter you into the Miracle Seekers Database as a visitor with third-level access.

	<text>Inside the station, you encounter a small multifunctional drone assistant, which seems to have been asked to meet you. "Welcome to the Station of Miracle Seekers - rest assured, you are completely safe here." You look around and see absolutely no one. The large size of the station contrasts with the fact that there is not a single living soul in the vicinity. "Our leader, Marauder, is currently unable to receive you and give you a tour of the station, so I have been instructed to escort you to Cipher, the one who you just contacted. She has urgent business for you."</text>

There are storage rooms filled with all sorts of Miracles everywhere, and it seems that the Miracles located here are of the utmost importance to the Miracle Seekers, as they are historical artifacts. Walking between the corridors of storage rooms and examining their contents, the drone finally leads you to Cipher. You already spoke with her before arriving at the station. "I am glad to see you here in person, Renegade. My code name as a Miracle Seeker is Cipher, and I am responsible for studying the history of the origin of various Miracles, as well as ensuring their preservation at the station and beyond." Woman is dressed in a beautiful white robe, and her round glasses with golden frames reveal her to be a very wise and well-read person. She shakes your hand and brings you up to speed.</text>

Due to its instability and the very fragile balance between chaos and order... we have opened a rift between our world and yours. While we were in this rift, we were unfortunate enough to encounter a series of dangers that led to the loss of many Miracles... I won't go into detail about how it happened, but we screwed up badly. We lost the artifact that connected us to our home universe, and worse, without it, we cannot return."
						
						"It is quite unstable and looks like a beam of white energy, resembling something like threads growing in all directions. The task should be simple, you just need to make sure this Miracle is safe and activate our delivery drone once you find it. It will safely collect it and send it to us. It's unlikely to be very difficult, but due to some of the Miracle's special properties, it's better to be safe than sorry and prepare for..." Cipher ponders how to best phrase the next thought and adjusts his glasses. "Prepare for battle. In your universe, Miracle 0900 has become so unstable that it will likely attract the attention of some... undesirable individuals. Otherwise, everything should go smoothly."</text>

									"I have a proposal for you... You give me the gnome for my personal needs, and I'll give you some resources as payment. Don't worry, I'm a master of my craft - you'll get rid of it once and for all if you hand it over."
