Because of this, she handed me over to the Miracle Seekers. They examined me, but could not define me. In the end, they gave up and locked me in the most secure chains.

Godmachine was sent to the eternal white deserts of Ichor and went into seclusion. Firewall... was forced to remain in the Born Wasteland. Presumption became the queen of Cerebrum, uniting the scattered states. Shield was sent there to assist the newly crowned queen, but eventually she gained independence.

He doesn't seem to like it very much, but at least it distracts him from his thoughts and prevents him from frightening the other crew members with his strange behavior. No, I don't mean to say that Slavik is strange, just... Let's be honest, Slavik is definitely Slavik. You can't take that away from him.</text>

	<text>Slavik is rushing around near your cabin with a piece of paper in his hand. When he sees you, he stops, looks at you for a couple of seconds, and hesitates to start a conversation. You decide to take the initiative and ask him what he wanted to show you. "It's... it's... you know, Captain, it's not very important. I'll probably come back later, when I've gathered my thoughts." After saying this, Slavik awkwardly walks away in the opposite direction - toward the hold room, where he obviously didn't need to go.</text>

	<text>You decide to find out what connections Slavik had with the rebels before and why he decided to become a mercenary. "I was born in Universe-1, with no idea what the Rebellion movement was really about. Like everyone else who wanted to climb the career ladder quickly, I joined a squad to cleanse this universe of alien life forms... anyone who wasn't human. However, some time after I got here, we were defeated by Mantises of the Hive, and my comrades abandoned me in order to distract the rest of the fleet. In the end... it's a long story. I was saved by a lone Mantis, who told me everything he knew about the other races and species. I became fascinated by such a diversity of living, self-aware species, and...", - You yawn, tired of Slavik's company, and simply walk away from him. He really isn't that interesting.</text>

	<text>Slavik rushes past you, heading somewhere. He says to himself: "They didn't give me a crewser! I don't have a unique ship! What kind of unique crew am I?!" You have no idea what he's talking about, but just in case, you note that Slavik needs to see a psychiatrist for the common good.</text>

	<text>You notice a bald spot on Slavik's head. Noticing your intense gaze at his hair, Slavik immediately guesses what you are thinking. "N-no! It's not... I'm not going bald! It's just the way the light hits my hair..." You ask Slavik to turn around and examine his hair more closely. Yes, it seems that it's not a bald spot after all. It's funny. But how does the light fall on his head in this particular way?</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_SLAVIK_POEM_1" unique="true">
	<text>You notice Slavik pacing back and forth near your cabin with the same piece of paper. You immediately strike up a conversation with him, wanting to know what is written on it. He gets scared. "Ah! Ah... It's my poem. I wrote it a long time ago, but I haven't shown it to anyone yet... For some reason, I decided that you might... read it?" You agree and reach out your hand for Slavik to give you his poem, but then he suddenly pulls away from you. "Oh, I think... there's a mistake. The rhyme is off, yes, definitely... I'm sorry, I'll be right back, I'll just fix this misunderstanding, and..." He can no longer make excuses - instead, he runs away from you.</text>

He mutters to himself, "This time it will definitely work..." You seize the initiative, snatching the piece of paper from his hands, but he is quicker than you - he takes it back from you and immediately runs off in the opposite direction without saying another word. It was definitely strange. From then on, Slavik no longer waits for you at your cabin.</text>

It runs on the energy of a star's decay, which is redistributed into reactor energy using intricate technology and a specific mechanism BUILT INTO the star! It was difficult to stabilize it and make its gravitational pull less dangerous for the ship, but I managed that too. This ship and its design are a real miracle.

You rush to check what happened and suddenly bump into Vakans, who has laid out a pile of tools on the floor, some of which you don't even know the purpose of, and is repairing one of the freezers. There is a fire extinguisher next to him. "Captain! How great that you came! I've already finished repairing this freezer. It seems that it's so old that instead of lowering the temperature inside, it started to raise it. The problem was very easy to fix, I just had to replace the IC-88-L element with a similar V-1-N, which I took out of our microwave oven. This will solve the problem for a while, but I recommend purchasing more IC-88-L components to prevent them from failing and causing the freezers to catch fire at the most unexpected moment." You are ready to swear that less than a minute passed between the ship's systems notifying you of the fire and your arrival at the cafeteria, but Vakans got there faster than you and managed not only to extinguish the fire, but also to fix everything.

It's not very good for your body, especially when it comes to sleep. I decided it would be better if I sewed bedding sets for the entire crew myself.

"Is that my handwriting? So... My blueprints! Yes, I remember, these are some of my designs, my prototypes! I thought I had forgotten them on the planet where I went into seclusion!"

"In order for the miracle to remain in storage at our station, it must first be entered into the Miracle Seekers Database, in accordance with formalities. This process depresses me, as I cannot concentrate on official documents and often write articles about Miracles in a perfunctory manner. Each Miracle Seeker has their own "style" of filling out the Database, but my style is probably to fill it out mediocrely. Because of this, Erudite constantly reprimands me and threatens to delete all the articles I have written that have not passed quality control."

Unfortunately, even after a long time and many medical procedures, I still couldn't remember anything new.

Confused, you scratch your head, and suddenly Mirrored repeats this action too. Now you lift one leg and stand on the other, and Mirrored does the same. You raise both arms, and, as expected, Mirrored does the same. You start jumping on one leg with your arms raised, but suddenly another crew member calls out to you. "Captain, what are you doing?" they say. You turn to the crew member and point to Mirrored.

	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Why is your body glitching?</text>

			<text>"Oh... how strange that you would make that assumption. No, it's not my body that's "glitching," it's the space around me that's "glitching." I suppose it shouldn't be that way, but I don't know how to fix it. But one thing I know for sure: the "glitch zone" around me grows about a centimeter every couple of years. I'm not sure yet what will happen when this zone expands to a meter or so. But Mecha, my friend and member of the Miracle Seekers, said that there's a 47.8% chance that nothing will happen, and a 52.2% chance that I could become a massive catastrophe on a universal scale. But a 47.8% chance is almost a 48% chance, and 48% is almost 50%, and a 50% chance is a 1 in 2 chance. So I don't think there's anything to be afraid of." As Mirrored was saying this, you unconsciously took a couple of steps back from her. Your quenched thirst for knowledge was hardly worth the acquired paranoia about the possible death of the universe because of Mirrored - for the next couple of decades.</text>

No, not the Miracle Seekers, but all living creatures in general, cannot find a way to prolong our little lives, which are only in its power. And even I cannot survive its appearance - there are things that are much greater than eternity itself." You can't even guess what Mirrored is talking about, so you just walk away from her.</text>

After these words, the Emperor asks you to leave.</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_WHITE_CLONE_GENERIC_6" unique="true">
	<text>You encounter the Emperor in the corridor. Bulky and tall, he barely allows you to squeeze past him to your destination. You wonder how large the corridors must be on the original Goliaths for the Emperor to move comfortably around the ship.</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_WHITE_CLONE_GARDEN_1" unique="true">
	<text>You notice that many new plants have appeared in the crew's recreation room, and the old ones are starting to look more well-groomed. You also catch Emperor White watering the flowers. He is embarrassed to see you and hastens to explain his actions. "If I didn't have the title of Emperor, I would definitely take up gardening, maybe even create my own garden, like a friend of mine. You don't mind that I decorated the lounge with these plants, do you?" You don't understand why the Emperor is asking for Renegade's permission, but just in case, you allow him to continue caring for the plants.</text>

<event name="SOCIALIZE_WHITE_CLONE_GARDEN_2" unique="true">
	<text>You enter the garden of Emperor White, and suddenly encounter not only him, but also a hologram of a young woman. "Oh, this is Renegade, who agreed to take the position of captain of my ship during his stay in this universe," White introduces you to his companion. "Wonderful, how are you?" the hologram of the girl asks you in a gentle voice, but immediately stops you mid-sentence. "This garden is beautiful, isn't it, Renegade? Of course, it can't compare to my Florarium of the Quiet Forest, but at this stage it already looks very nice. White has done an excellent job. By the way, nice to meet you, my name is Elizabeth, and I am the current queen of the Outcast society. Not the "Outcast" of your universes, but ours." White hastens to explain the purpose of Elizabeth's presence on this ship: "Elizabeth and I are conducting political negotiations on the unification of the Empire and the Outcasts, whom we pursued and destroyed while the original Emperor White was in office. Now those days are gone, and peace reigns between us." Elizabeth smirks, implying that she was somehow involved in depriving the original Emperor White of his status as Emperor, but without any dark undertones. "Would you mind leaving for a moment and leaving me alone with Elizabeth until we finish our negotiations?" says the Emperor, and you decide to leave them alone. As you leave, you notice that there were two mugs of tea on the table. You wonder why they were there, since neither Elizabeth's hologram nor the Emperor's clone can consume liquids. This question will keep you awake tonight.</text>
