Miracle Seekers did not enter this universe of their own free will, and it will not be possible for them to return for a long time. Upon arriving in Sector 5, head to the beacon of their station to learn more about this organization and receive specific tasks from them. Of course, they have many secrets and do not always tell the whole truth, but right now, only you can help them with their numerous problems.

The meta-reputation system will allow you to befriend the Miracle Seekers. Each time you complete their tasks, you will receive new opportunities at their station - from obtaining some information about their home universe to receiving regular gifts from them in gratitude for your long friendship.</description></metadata>
